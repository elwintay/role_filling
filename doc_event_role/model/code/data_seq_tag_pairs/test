us O

why O

the O
main O
reason O
is O
the O
very O
complicated O
pre O

the O

much O

because O

the O
brutal O

the O

of O

. O
let O
us O
recall O
, O
as O
a O
significant O
fact O
, O
that O
the O
united O
nations O
has O
condemned O
the O
government B-perp_organization_id
because O
of O
all O
it O
has O
done O
, O
especially O
because O
of O
the O
latest O
atrocities O
. O
on O
that O
occasion O
, O
el O
salvador O
was O
the O
only O
country O
that O
voted O
against O
that O
resolution O
while O
96 O
countries O
voted O

TST3-MUC4-0076
we O
mention O
this O
case O
as O
a O
most O
significant O
one O
, O
but O
the O
fact O
is O
that O
there O
has O
been O
so O
much O
worldwide O
condemnation O
that O
the O
dictatorship O
has O
found O
itself O
in O
a O
really O
desperate O
situation O
. O
this O
was O
a O
cause O
of O
concern O
for O
the O
north O
americans O
. O
to O
whom O
could O
they O
turn O
at O
a O
time O
when O
all O
international O
organizations O
had O
turned O
their O
backs O
on O
cr O
##ist O
##iani O
? O

TST3-MUC4-0076
the O
north O
americans O
had O
to O
resort O
to O
some O
forum O
that O
would O
not O
condemn O
the O
gen O
##oc O

and O
that O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
would O
provide O
support O
in O
spite O
of O
all O
the O
atrocities O
the O
regime O
has O
committed O
. O
the O
most O
suitable O
idea O
was O
to O
promote O
an O
emergency O
meeting O
of O
central O
american O
presidents O
, O
because O
in O
central O
america O
, O
as O
we O
all O

the O
north O

have O
had O
their O
