(vargas) two people were killed and five others were wounded as a result of the attack.  the two people who were killed are yet to be identified.  those wounded include three employees of the gas station where the car bomb went off and two people who were walking by the gas station at the moment of the explosion.  preliminary reports have estimated that the explosion caused 70 million pesos in losses.    (carrillo) general, approximately how many kilograms of explosives were in the car bomb?    (vargas) apparently it contained 60 kg of dynamite.  the dynamite was placed inside an old station wagon.  something must have happened to the people who were inside the vehicle at the time of the explosion -- the two people who were killed.  apparently the car bomb went off by accident.  it was not supposed to have gone off at that gas station.    (carrillo) have the people who were killed been identified?    (vargas) no, not yet.  we are trying to identify them now.    (carrillo) are there special security measures to counter this wave of terrorism?    (vargas) yes, of course.  we are carrying out a series of joint actions with the bogota police department and administrative department of security personnel to neutralize terrorist actions.  we are carrying out those actions in areas we consider critical or vulnerable and in other areas where we are counteracting and neutralizing terrorist actions, as i told you.    (carrillo) are there secret agents throughout the entire city?    (vargas) yes, we have uniformed and civilian personnel guarding the city right now.  we also have the support of the bogota police department, of dijin (directorate of judicial police and investigations), and of cijin (expansion unknown). they are cooperating with us.  they are guarding areas we consider critical or places that could be targets of terrorist attacks.    (carrillo) what other measures have you adopted along with the 13th infantry brigade and the bogota mayor?    (vargas) we have implemented a number of measures, such as increasing personnel on the streets and human and material resources. in addition, we have established chekckpoints in areas we consider critical and are carrying out a number of operational activities that will help us locate these criminals.",

(begin recording) (rueda) communications to and from puerto petrolero and bucaramanga have been cut off since early today, after an attempt to dynamite the multipurpose pipeline destroyed a 100-meter section of the central highway.    the supply of gas to bucaramanga will also be affected by this event. it is estimated that it will take at least 3 days to restore normal traffic, because it will be necessary to use dynamite to remove rocks currently blocking the highway.    the attempted sabotage occurred at the 65-km mark on the bucaramanga - barrancabermeja highway, 20 km from the place where a military convoy was ambushed last wednesday. this is the second time that an attempted sabotage of the bucaramanga - barrancabermeja multipurpose pipeline, which carries propane gas, gasoline, and acpm (not further identified) has taken place. the explosion destroyed a 30-meter section of pipeline, and sparked a fire that has not yet been extinguished.    losses caused by the sabotage, which has been attributed to the eln, have yet to be ascertained. it is estimated that repairs to the highway alone will cost the public works ministry 5 million pesos.    (ismael orozco, public works director for the 5th district) well, after initial talks with ecopetrol (colombian petroleum enterprise) technicians today, beginning at 1700, after the fire is under control, they will begin restoring service on the oil pipeline.    (rueda) at this time, there is traffic congestion near the sugamoso bridge. (end recording) (passage omitted)    while still on the subject, ecopetrol's president, who traveled this morning to barrancabermeja to attend a forum on the magdalena river, reported that, so far this year, terrorist attacks have cost his company $300 million.  we have this report from maria clara gracia.    (begin recording) (gracia) ecopetrol has lost 95 billion pesos in revenues this year due to the 44 terrorist attacks on the cano limon - covenas oil pipeline. in these attacks, 13.2 million barrels of crude oil have been lost. the areas most affected by these attacks are in sucre, arauca, norte de santander, and santander departments.    (reporter alvaro ayala) doctor, could these terrorist attacks lead to an increase in fuel prices in colombia?    (dr andres restrepo londono, president of ecopetrol) obviously, there will come a time when, faced with increasing internal production costs and falling revenues, we are going to have to consider compensating our losses with an increase in domestic oil prices, but that is a measure we are not about to adopt at this time.    (gracia) today's landslide, which destroyed a section of the multipurpose pipeline between barrancabermeja and bucaramanga, has resulted in estimated losses totalling 1.435 billion pesos.

        "doc": "presumed shining path maoist extremists ambushed and killed 68 peasants in the locality of balcon, 200 km north of the southern city of ayacucho.    a peasant defense patrol unit was combing the area in search of guerrillas when it was ambushed on 22 november, the newspaper expreso reported today.    the wave of violence has hit peruvian tourist establishments in the city of huaraz, capital of the ancash department, where four inns and hotels were bombed last night, damaging the buildings and injuring an 18 year-old girl.    in cusco, 1,000 km southeast of lima, a bus (as received) heading toward machu pichu went out of control as the result of sabotage and fell into a 60-meter ravine. the wives of the jersey city, united states, and cusco mayors died in this accident.    leftist senator enrique bernales ballesteros, president of the special commission for the investigation and study of terrorism and violence, has noted that the escalation of violence has claimed the lives of 21 people per day during the month of november. he said that the increased violence can be traced to actions by the terrorist groups shining path and tupac amaru revolutionary movement (mrta). these attacks were repressed by the forces of order.    senator bernales reported that 630 people were killed in violent acts in november and that 1,775 have been killed over the past 12 months.    bernales said that 403 people were killed in november as a result of violent acts, including 147 civilians, 165 presumed terrorists, 65 armed forces members, and 26 drug traffickers. a total of 227 people were killed in urban violent acts.    senator bernales added that a total of nearly 13,000 people have been killed since the terrorist violence began in 1980.    bernales expressed his concern over the fact that 67 percent of the people killed in violent acts involved youths who were between 15 and 29 years of age. he asked the government to establish guidelines to counter this social phenomenon.    amid this bloody and destructive situation, the peruvian episcopal conference has made a christmas appeal, asking that--without ignoring \"the seriousness of the situation\"--for a truce \"for peace, reconciliation, and tranquillity\" to prevail in the country.    the bishops said: \"recalling he who prevailed over death, we call upon those who have resorted to violence and killings as a solution to the evils of society, to allow the citizens for whom they claim to struggle to live like brothers.\"",
