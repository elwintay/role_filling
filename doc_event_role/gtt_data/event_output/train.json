            "doc": "goodbye (air force commander) general rafael bustillo, false hope for mass killers.  gen.  bustillo resigns or is made to resign as the air force chief.  because of this, the general is admitting that without the bombing on san salvador's neighborhoods the fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front) would have defeated the salvadoran armed forces.  bustillo's resignation is yet another sign of the failure of 10 years of the u.s. counterinsurgency policy in el salvador, as became clear with the offensive launched on 10 november.    for 10 years the military and their u.s. sponsors based their trust in the air power to drown in blood the aspiration of the nation to achieve democracy and social justice.  this first happened in the interior of the country, with the destruction of dozens of towns like tenancingo, berlin, torola, san fernando, and so many others that took place along with the genocide carried out by the infantry with the mass murders of civilians in el mosoto, sunpul, and ocotapayo.  bustillo is leaving as so many generals and u.s. ambassadors have.  and like all of them his departure reveals the imperialist power's failure to consolidate its counterinsurgency program in el salvador.    as all the others who have left, bustillo also seeks excuses in the face of his failure, by accusing others.  he accuses (former defense minister eugenio) vides casanova of being soft in fighting the people's plan.  one would have to ask bustillo if the air force, of which he represented its most encouraging pillar, was soft when it murdered 70,000 salvadorans, monsignor arnulfo romero and the jesuit priests included, and even when it murdered patriot officers of that same army.  was the u.s. pentagon soft when it gave $3 billion, weapons, and bombs for the most cowardly act of genocide latin america can recall this century?    the u.s. strategy, implemented through the top military command in the past 10 years with all its might did all it could so that the permanent rebellion in the rural areas reached the country's vital centers, as indeed happened as of the 10 november offensive.  bustillo states it clearly.    the bombing temporarily halted the defeat of the top command.  through an act of genocide, it managed to remove the disgruntled people from the neighborhoods where the guerrilla forces were.  bustillo acknowledges genocide is the sole way the armed forces can survive.  bustillo acknowledges the fmln's strength and therefore urges the armed forces to be tougher and inflexible and rejects a political solution to the conflict.  a political solution would express the consensus among the country's major sectors.  obviously the top command represents a decadent minority. bustillo supports launching a fascist crusade against the people's wish for democracy.  in this effort, he lashes out at the catholic church, all opposition sectors that report human rights violations, and all sectors that support democratizing the country.  in conclusion, we say that bustillo is not resigning of his own volition.  the fmln action eliminated bustillo as it eliminated garcia, vides, and so many other military chiefs who left their posts without fulfilling the task commissioned by the united states: to stop the fmln.    the fmln offensive bared the genocidal, antipopular, and fascist nature of the alfredo cristiani regime to such an extent that it prompted a strong debate in the united states on cutting military aid.  the jesuits' murders and the bombings so shook the international community that it is pressuring for punishment of the officers involved in these incidents.  however, the bush administration accepted this, since colonel rene emilio ponce (chairman of the joints chiefs of staff) and his clique, even cristiani, must shoulder this responsibility.  we must not forget that in costa rica the salvadoran defense minister disclosed cristiani authorized the bombings.    bush needed a scapegoat to place it on the altar of the debates which will begin in the u.s. congress on the fate of military aid.  bustillo is bush's scapegoat.  however, bustillo was already a useless element of the murderous machinery that remains active.  will the u.s. public and congress be appeased with this foul tasting candy?  time and the spirit of the times are obviously running against the fascist program in el salvador.  while peoples of the world tear down dogmas, dictatorships, and walls, bustillo, who leaves through the door of defeat, asks the armed forces to be tougher, commit more genocide, and build more walls of repression against the church, the people, and the nation as a whole.  goodbye, gen. bustillo.  we continue writing history without you.  the decade we begin is of democracy, independence, and self-determination.  that is why foreign intervention and the walls of intolerance have a short life span in this country, where the people grow in heroism and the struggle for social change is not deterred by bombings.",

(begin recording) (rosa chavez) it seems that the president should be recognized for having had the courage to keep his promise to conduct a thorough investigation.  we understand that he has not yet revealed the details of this crime but that he will do so soon.    however, i want to say something that has not been said: the church is not interested in learning who the murderers are just for the truth to come out.  the church wants this punishment to mean that impunity has ended in el salvador; that the poor will feel certain that justice will prevail for them; that so many crimes that have been forgotten will be solved little by little; but mainly, that from now on, crimes will no longer go unsolved. (end recording)    msgr rosa chavez added that the tone of verbal violence must be lowered since this only results in a useless confrontation and promotes a polarization of the conflict, as well as hinders any effort to apply justice.  he said that the verbal war is as harmful as irrational violence. he said that irresponsible charges and accusations continue in the country, and they do not help strengthen the peace process.    (begin recording) (rosa chavez) it is important to overcome verbal violence.  this means that a calm climate, a climate that is as impartial as possible, must be sought to discuss issues.  we recall that last year, many violent statements were made.  many harsh expressions were uttered.  (words indistinct) too many heated statements printed in some newspapers.  the language used is too harsh.  i think that to obtain justice, we need a calmer climate. (end recording)    he added that a climate of serenity and respect would facilitate the right conditions for a dialogue that would guarantee mechanisms to reconcile our society.  he urged the government and the judicial authorities to continue making progress in the review of the judicial system to reorganize it in a way that will allow the honest adminstration of justice to do away with impunity.",

(zamora) the fact that president cristiani acknowledges that members of the army were responsible for the massacre is a first step and definitely a good thing, but it is entirely insufficient unless the subsequent steps are also taken.  first, to identify who the responsible parties were:  this is the first important point, because nobody can feel satisfied if only low-ranking officers are identified.  such an act can only have been ordered by high-ranking officers.  we must not forget the murder of monsignor romero, for which there were no sentences and no trials.    (oppes) however, the armed forces high command immediately denied involvement in the operation, stating that it was an isolated action \"divorced from any institutional policy.\"    (zamora) i believe this is entirely wrong: the murder of the jesuit fathers cannot be considered an isolated action.  over 7,000 people have died in el salvador during 10 years of civil war, and 90 percent of them were civilians.  political assassination by the government forces is a constant practice.  furthermore, torture is regularly practised in el salvador.  the army high command cannot fail to know this.  they cannot claim to be innocent, because they have the greatest responsibilities for human rights violations.    (oppes) yet last month the summit of central american heads of state in san jose ended with a success for president cristiani, who secured an explicit condemnation of the offensive launched by the guerrillas in november, whereas no specific charges were leveled at the government for human rights violations.    (zamora) there is a positive factor that should be borne in mind, namely, the call from the five presidents for a resumption of the dialogue in el salvador and the appeal to the un secretary general to carry out mediation to this end.  but in the summit's final document, it is the fmln and the nicaraguan contras who pay the price for the agreement among the presidents: these are diplomatic games that do not facilitate the restoration of peace in central america.    (oppes) what paths can be taken now to advance the negotiations?    (zamora) negotiations are becoming increasingly necessary.  the guerrilla offensive shows that the fmln is a strong military force, but also that a revolutionary attitude does not exist among the masses.  it also shows that the government army, after 10 years of u.s. training, is an army whose military stance is defensive, not offensive (which is the key to u.s. military strategy.)  while this all shows that there can only be a negotiated solution to the crisis, it is also true that precisely following the guerrilla offensive (and this is the paradox) the army stiffened its stance against negotiations.  i believe that sooner or later common sense will prevail and it will sit down at the negotiating table.  at the end of november the u.s. secretary of state's assistant for latin america spoke officially for the first time about the need for negotiations to resolve the crisis in el salvador: this is an important sign of a changing situation.",

(passage indistinct)...the jesuits' murders or the cancellation of aid.    if it is true that the army--which murdered monsigno oscar romero, 1,000 peasants in el mozote, 70 indians in las hojas, hundreds of salvadorans in zunpu, and unionists at the fenastras (salvadoran workers national union federation) offices, along with the rest of the armed forces' well-known crimes--is going to be purged at last, if this is really true, then we would have to say that a true negotiation will start.  in the past, the fmln has made proposals for negotiations to end the war.      one of our demands, a realistic demand to propitiate peace in el salvador, is undoubtedly the purge of the army.  in mexcio and in san jose, costa rica, we said that if the government did not accept the fmln's proposal, the nation would do so.  and that is what has happened.  the nation demands that the armed forces be purged.    the most important u.s. newspapers and newscasts have noted the irrefutable fact that 10 years of u.s. advice and an investment of more than $3 billion--very close to $4 billion--to create a huge buildup in their armaments have not served to change the mentality of an army that murdered monsignor romero and thousands of civilians, including nuns and u.s. advisers.  we believe democratic senator christopher dodd was mistaken when he said that u.s. aid in itself was not being discussed.  the 10 years of aid, advice, and u.s. strategy in el salvador have proven to be a failure. if the united states has any intentions of contributing to peace, now is the time to change its policy toward el salvador.    events have placed the issue of the continuation of aid to el salvador on the congressmen's worktables.  the aid was made conditional on punishment for the jesuits' murders.  but what is the order of the day?  it is a decision that goes beyond a basic demand for justice.  it will determine the continuation of u.s. aid.  it entails the decision to turn their policy around to contribute to a political solution in el salvador.  they are to discuss whether congress' position is to be: one, we approve the purge of the army and thus we will give them more aid, or, two, we approve the purge as a concrete step to democratization and will suspend military aid so that these conditions can be used to reach a negotiated political solution.    will u.s. congressmen be capable of surprising the world by helping the salvadorans to topple the fascist wall, the wall of war?  will they do this by stopping military aid?  the fmln has said clearly that if the united states stops aid to the army it will correspond with actions to reach a complete halt in hostilities.  we hope the u.s. congress does not make a mistake.  if it stops aid, if it cuts it, if it ends it, we will stand before a clear and hopeful sign for peace.  however, if not, we will stand before yet another sign of war, and the surprise will not be a good one.",

(valdes) mr president, will the three branches of government and the armed forces adopt additional security measures?    (azcona) yes, we will be discussing that soon.  i have a meeting scheduled with the national security council, which will also be attended by the three presidents of the state branches.  i mean, the (words indistinct) will chair the meeting, and national congress president carlos arbin montoya and supreme court president salomon jimenez castro will also attend.  we have also invited the candidates of the two (number as heard) parties to this meeting since one of them is going to be the next honduran president.  we plan to establish some guideline--some rules to be followed--not just for the remainder of our term but in the future as well, because we should be farsighted and not just concentrate on the short term, which has been very common in honduras, where we look and find solutions only for the present. we should find solutions jointly (words indistinct) in the long run, which includes the issue of violence.  we believe in a democracy like ours, which is a very complete democracy.  in other words, there are internal elections for selecting candidates, where citizens enjoy full rights, where parties and party leaders consult with the people, where we have true, clean, and honest elections, where we have a national electoral commission that is not influenced by nor can it be influenced by the government, and where the state branches are totally independent.    all of these characteristics make honduras a democracy, and every sector of honduran society should strive to strengthen them by avoiding violence at all costs, obeying the law, and condemning and attacking extreme terrorist groups regardless of their affiliation, thus enabling us to consolidate our democracy and reach the level of political development attained by other democratic countries.    it has been demonstrated worldwide that progress and development can only be achieved through democracy.  the frg, the mediterranean countries--italy, france, and spain--are examples of this, and there is the case of japan, which has a liberal democratic system and has achieved extraordinary levels of development.  taiwan is yet another example.  at this stage...    (valdes, interrupting) yes, but this takes time.    (azcona) yes.  at this stage i believe there is sufficient proof that the democratic system is the best means of attaining higher levels of development.  there is no doubt in anyone's mind about that, but the fact that we have this system is not enough.  each one of us, each sector, must do his part to make it work.    when i mention sectors, i am referring to private enterprise, which must be generous, exhibit confidence in the country, and show much initiative; to organized labor groups, which must fight for their rights without fomenting strikes and other disorders, which are sometimes brought about illegally instead of following the normal legal procedures; to professional associations, which also have an enormous responsibility, because their members must comply with their duties; and the same goes for government employees and others.    in other words, this will not be accomplished by this or the next government alone.  our governments are transitory and their power is relative.  i have said this many times.  there is no point in lashing out at the president, because power in honduras is relative and conditional. what is essential is to contribute positively toward honduras' development.  this should be a responsibility not only of public employees, businessmen, workers, and organized peasants, but all hondurans should contribute.  that is what counts.    (valdes) mr president, when will this meeting be held and what immediate measures will you propose?    (azcona) the appropriate authorities are doing everything possible to investigate the latest crime, which was not an everyday occurrence like a robbery or something of that nature.  this crime was carefully planned.  it was a terrorist act perpetrated by professionals.    (valdes) mr president, some people have been saying that the death penalty might be a way to cope with the situation.  what do you think about this?    (azcona) i recently read something about the death penalty in a mexican magazine.  the death penalty is opposed by a majority of the people and has been abolished in honduras.  i do not think this is the solution here because the death penalty has not solved the crime problem anywhere else in the world.  for instance, this penalty exists in many u.s. states, but this has not deterred criminals from committing terrible crimes.  people have lost control.  when criminals have no respect for their fellow man, not even the death penalty can stop them.  however, there are crimes, such as drug trafficking, for which no bail should be permitted.  i think a bill that has been proposed by the supreme court of justice should be passed by the congress.  of course, it will be approved by the president so those found guilty of this crime cannot be bailed out.  it is not right for the authorities to arrest a drug trafficker only to see him released on bail by a judge who has no other choice than to abide by the law.    (valdes) mr president, the far rightist group aaa (anticommunist action alliance), through a local radio station, warned that they will take revenge on major communist leaders, such as jorge arturo reina, ramon custodio, and others.  what do you have to say about this?    (azcona) i am adamantly opposed to this type of revenge because it would only lead to escalated confrontations between groups.  i condemn this attitude in view of the regrettable murder of general gustavo alvarez martinez.  as far as the death penalty goes, it will not be a solution to the crime problem.    (valdes) mr president, civic committees have to be organized in the country.    (azcona) i agree, but these committees should be controlled by the authorities.  a civic committee to protect communities is one thing, but it is quite another thing to sue these committees to perform duties that are already the responsibility of state agencies, such as the armed forces.    (valdes) when will the government branches meet?    (azcona) they will meet when i return from caracas.",

(begin recording) (attorney general roberto garcial alvarado) the video for example is not evidence.  the contents of the video must be reaffirmed by the persons who in one way or another participated in the preparation, and the accuracy of the contents narrated in that video must be legally determined.

(begin recording) (attorney general roberto garcial alvarado) the judge in charge of the case has issued resolutions ordering the summons of ivon flores and sworn statements from the two officials mentioned. (end recording)    these new resolutions of the fourth criminal court judge on msgr romero's case were issued at the request of the attorney general's office, which demonstrates, the attorney general said, that he is not an undertaker of trials, much less of people.    vice president antonio castillo claramount said the supreme court of justice has the moral obligation to punish the murderers of msgr romero, including major roberto d'aubuisson.  the vice president also insisted the legislative assembly has a responsibility to see that those guilty of the murder of msgr romero be punished.  however, he stressed the supreme court must act.  he said the investigation must continue and gather all the evidence to solve this case, which occurred in march 1980.",

(begin recording) (samayoa) there is no doubt.  all the investigations carried out by the commission point to maj roberto d'aubuisson as the mastermind.  this has to be proven in court.  however, he has parliamentary immunity; he cannot be brought to court.  the nationalist republican alliance (arena) has the majority in the national assembly, and arena is not going to permit a declaration that will bring his case to court. (end recording)    dr samayoa also said he is willing to present all the evidence he has on the case.  however, he said he did not trust the behavior of the attorney general of the republic:    (begin recording) (samayoa) we will present the evidence.  i think they are going to be sorry they made that request, because many persons are involved.  since their participation has not yet been proven, these names have not yet been released.  however, when we present the entire dossier to the courts, these names are going to come up.  then some will judge and decide if they participated or not.  but their names are there, as are their activities and their relationships to the death squads.  many persons who are mentioned are apparently respectable, and i mean respectable in quotes.  (end recording)    the assassination of msgr oscar arnulfo romero took place on 24 march 1980; according to the official, the investigations have taken 9 years because many persons considered key witnesses have died since the time of the murder.  however, he added, with the cooperation of the fbi as well as some central american investigation organizations, the case has been clarified, which might lead to the imprisonment of maj d'aubuisson once he loses his parliamentary immunity.",

(end recording)    de la sotta added that all possible efforts will be made to overcome the impasse.  the major problem now involves the 17 million boxes that arrived at their ports of destination ready for distribution.  now no one knows what to do with them.  there are 7 or 8 million boxes more being shipped to the same ports, and 3 million boxes remain in the country, ready to be shipped. de la sotta said that the cyanide was found in two single grapes.

(reporter) what can the government do about the fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front)?    (ponce) we can ask them to join the country's democratic, civic life to (words indistinct) people to live in peace.    (reporter) how do you view the voting situation and the security and surveillance the armed forces is providing, especially now that the armed forces are being charged with the death of two journalists?  i think you are aware of that.  tell us something about that.    (ponce) we are the first ones to regret the death of the canal doce newsmen who died in san miguel and the reuter correspondent who died here on army boulevard.  those deaths are the result of the prevailing unrest and nervousness.  there are bullets being fired all over the place and, unfortunately, those reporters were the first to get hit.  this continues to be a problem that the armed forces has (words indistinct).    (reporter) did the army suffer casualties during the incidents in san ramon?    (ponce) i can tell you that a bracamonte battalion corporal died and another soldier was wounded.  however, the 1st infantry brigade and bracamonte battalion soldiers reacted quickly and repelled the terrorist activity that is currently causing chaos in san salvador.      (reporter) have other incidents been reported?    (ponce) it is difficult to believe what the fmln is saying. their spokesman in mexico city said they would not attack the voting tables. however, we have heard that voting tables have been attacked in 15 areas of the country.  attacks on voting tables were reported in chalatenango, san antonio, ciudad barrios, carolina, and north (word indistinct).  in usulutan, the fmln planted two bombs just outside the city to frighten the people.  however, our people's democratic nature is telling the fmln:  we do not want terrorism, we want peace, and we are using peaceful means to achieve power and choose our president and vice president.    (reporter) how is the voting process progressing throughout the country?    (ponce) there are 27 municipalities where elections are not being held. we know for sure that there are municipalities, like cinquera and arambala, where (words indistinct), and we also know that (words indistinct).  we know there are 27 municipalities where there will be no voting and there are others that (words indistinct) that the representatives of the political parties and members of the municipal voting table boards (words indistinct).    (reporter) how many soldiers are protecting the voting table boards throughout the country?    (ponce) about 80 percent of our soldiers are part of the democracy plan. we are going to continue offering the same protection after the voting centers are closed (words indistinct).    (reporter) we have read some reports that the armed forces are urging the people to vote for the christian democratic party (pdc).  will the soldiers be allowed to vote?    (ponce) first, i emphatically and categorically deny that we are urging the people to vote for the pdc.  we have sent a memorandum to all the commanders and (word indistinct) chiefs advising them that we must have a completely apolitical attitude and refrain from participating in any political activity.  we must protect all political parties, we must protect all the voting centers, and we must ensure the safety of the areas surrounding the voting centers.  we are not interested in who wins the elections; we are interested in making sure that the will of the people is respected and (words indistinct).  this is a day for the salvadoran people to prove their democratic nature.    (reporter) will soldiers be allowed to cast their votes today?    (ponce) as soldiers we all have the right to vote.  but before we cast our vote we are going to fulfill our duty.  our duty is to guarantee safety.  this will not create a problem.  for example, if a soldier's identification card was issued in san salvador but he is stationed in aguilares, he will be allowed to vote at a specific voting center.  those who can vote will do so as civilians and they will be unarmed.  (words indistinct) mostly administrative personnel and (word indistinct).    (reporter) (words indistinct) the rebels have threatened to launch a large attack.  do you have enough men to fight them at this time?    (ponce) since 1982, we have (words indistinct) democratic process in the country.  the people (words indistinct) before and after the elections.

            "doc": "political life in colombia is still linked with violence.....    (cepeda) colombia is experiencing an extremely severe political and institutional crisis, caused by the incompatibility between the fast developing productive forces and the existing political setup.  for example, last year colombia's economic growth was 4.5 percent.  however, political life continues to be dominated by the two old parties -- the liberals and the conservatives, who maintain a merely formal democracy.  we should not forget colombia's strategic position:  it forms a bridge between central and south america.  all events in colombia affect the neighboring countries.      precisely because of this, the so-called \"santa fe-2\" document, drawn up by extreme right-wing u.s. politicians, contains a plan to apply pressure in colombia and, more specifically, to expand the so-called low-intensity conflict, one of whose manifestations is the so-called \"dirty war\" in the country.    accordingly, the violence in colombia is caused by both internal factors -- the crisis of the institutions -- and external ones, namely the policies of the most reactionary circles in the united states.    (sertov) can one expect the peace settlement to be fulfilled under these conditions?    (cepeda) this is the aim of the communist party of colombia (pcc).  at our recent 15th congress, we made a detailed analysis of the situation and concluded that the conflict in colombia must be settled by political means. the pcc raised the question of removing the siege situation that, with a few interruptions, has been maintained for several decades, and of disbanding the paramilitary groups (according to the minister of internal affairs, about 140 such groups are operating).  these groups owe their very existence to the support given by military circles and the clan chiefs to the trade in narcotics.  (i will add in parentheses that this is the reason for the use of the term \"narcomilitarism\" in colombia.) one of the pcc's demands is that the army should be purged of fascist elements and that a civilian should be put in charge of the ministry of defense.  the party also raised the question of making a start on the necessary democratic reforms, but the government pays no heed to our demands.    the government recently reached an agreement with \"m-19,\" one of the partisan groupings in the country, but did not accept any commitments in practice.  accordingly, there are some doubts over how the lives of the partisan leaders will be subsequently guaranteed.  the largest partisan group -- the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -- is demanding that the government take serious steps to limit the paramilitary groups, in order to conclude a truce.    (sertov) clearly, it will not be easy to achieve peace in colombia.    (cepeda) at the moment, peace supporters in colombia are forming  a broad front, which in practice has an antifascist orientation.  peace depends on how far this front will succeed in expanding, how the contradictions within the government itself regarding the paramilitary groups will deepen, and on whether we will succeed in isolating them.  we are optimists, but also have a great need of international solidarity.    (sertov) how do you assess the political prospects for the united left in your country?    (cepeda) the left forces in colombia are united in the patriotic union that was created 4 years ago.  its aim is to achieve national reconciliation in our country.  however, the union immediately became a target of the organizers of the \"dirty war.\" hundreds of its leaders were beaten up, many of whom were pcc members.  so far, over 1,000 people have died, including jaime pardo leal, leader of the patriotic union, deputy chairman jose anteguera, and others.  threats continue to be made against the union and against the pcc.  all members of the pcc leadership have received death threats.  the same also applies to bernardo jaramillo, the present leader of the union, gilberto vieira, secretary general of the pcc central committee, and others.    on 27 february comrade forero (name as transliterated), pcc secretary for organizational matters, was killed.  his wife and comrades sotelo and sotomayor also died in the atrocity.  next day, we had a meeting with virgilio barco, president of colombia.  he promises to take speedy measures against the paramilitary groups.  however, only 4 days later, anteguera, the former leader of the union of communist youth, was killed at bogota airport.  senator ernesto pisano, one of the liberal party candidates for the presidency, was seriously injured at the same time.  many members of the military were present at the airport on that day, as well as the police chief of the capital, yet only one of the murderers was killed, while the rest escaped.  this is why we told president barco that we had serious doubts about the army's role in this assassination.      next year, presidential elections and elections of the legislative bodies are due to take place in colombia.  the pcc and the patriotic union want to take part in them, but we have warned the leaders of the republic that unless the \"dirty war\" is ended, we will expose the situation in colombia to the world and regard the election results as illegal.  despite everything, we consider that the patriotic union has a promising future, because its aims are supported by the colombian people.",

            "doc": "political life in colombia is still linked with violence.....    (cepeda) colombia is experiencing an extremely severe political and institutional crisis, caused by the incompatibility between the fast developing productive forces and the existing political setup.  for example, last year colombia's economic growth was 4.5 percent.  however, political life continues to be dominated by the two old parties -- the liberals and the conservatives, who maintain a merely formal democracy.  we should not forget colombia's strategic position:  it forms a bridge between central and south america.  all events in colombia affect the neighboring countries.      precisely because of this, the so-called \"santa fe-2\" document, drawn up by extreme right-wing u.s. politicians, contains a plan to apply pressure in colombia and, more specifically, to expand the so-called low-intensity conflict, one of whose manifestations is the so-called \"dirty war\" in the country.    accordingly, the violence in colombia is caused by both internal factors -- the crisis of the institutions -- and external ones, namely the policies of the most reactionary circles in the united states.    (sertov) can one expect the peace settlement to be fulfilled under these conditions?    (cepeda) this is the aim of the communist party of colombia (pcc).  at our recent 15th congress, we made a detailed analysis of the situation and concluded that the conflict in colombia must be settled by political means. the pcc raised the question of removing the siege situation that, with a few interruptions, has been maintained for several decades, and of disbanding the paramilitary groups (according to the minister of internal affairs, about 140 such groups are operating).  these groups owe their very existence to the support given by military circles and the clan chiefs to the trade in narcotics.  (i will add in parentheses that this is the reason for the use of the term \"narcomilitarism\" in colombia.) one of the pcc's demands is that the army should be purged of fascist elements and that a civilian should be put in charge of the ministry of defense.  the party also raised the question of making a start on the necessary democratic reforms, but the government pays no heed to our demands.    the government recently reached an agreement with \"m-19,\" one of the partisan groupings in the country, but did not accept any commitments in practice.  accordingly, there are some doubts over how the lives of the partisan leaders will be subsequently guaranteed.  the largest partisan group -- the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -- is demanding that the government take serious steps to limit the paramilitary groups, in order to conclude a truce.    (sertov) clearly, it will not be easy to achieve peace in colombia.    (cepeda) at the moment, peace supporters in colombia are forming  a broad front, which in practice has an antifascist orientation.  peace depends on how far this front will succeed in expanding, how the contradictions within the government itself regarding the paramilitary groups will deepen, and on whether we will succeed in isolating them.  we are optimists, but also have a great need of international solidarity.    (sertov) how do you assess the political prospects for the united left in your country?    (cepeda) the left forces in colombia are united in the patriotic union that was created 4 years ago.  its aim is to achieve national reconciliation in our country.  however, the union immediately became a target of the organizers of the \"dirty war.\" hundreds of its leaders were beaten up, many of whom were pcc members.  so far, over 1,000 people have died, including jaime pardo leal, leader of the patriotic union, deputy chairman jose anteguera, and others.  threats continue to be made against the union and against the pcc.  all members of the pcc leadership have received death threats.  the same also applies to bernardo jaramillo, the present leader of the union, gilberto vieira, secretary general of the pcc central committee, and others.    on 27 february comrade forero (name as transliterated), pcc secretary for organizational matters, was killed.  his wife and comrades sotelo and sotomayor also died in the atrocity.  next day, we had a meeting with virgilio barco, president of colombia.  he promises to take speedy measures against the paramilitary groups.  however, only 4 days later, anteguera, the former leader of the union of communist youth, was killed at bogota airport.  senator ernesto pisano, one of the liberal party candidates for the presidency, was seriously injured at the same time.  many members of the military were present at the airport on that day, as well as the police chief of the capital, yet only one of the murderers was killed, while the rest escaped.  this is why we told president barco that we had serious doubts about the army's role in this assassination.      next year, presidential elections and elections of the legislative bodies are due to take place in colombia.  the pcc and the patriotic union want to take part in them, but we have warned the leaders of the republic that unless the \"dirty war\" is ended, we will expose the situation in colombia to the world and regard the election results as illegal.  despite everything, we consider that the patriotic union has a promising future, because its aims are supported by the colombian people.",

(posledni) in the course of a few days at the beginning of march, three leading officials of the colombian communist party and the leftist coalition, the patriotic union (up), comrades forero, sotelo, and antequera, were murdered in colombia.  why?      (cepeda) in colombia the dirty war stemming from the american tactics of so-called low-intensity conflict is intensifying.  the internal political crisis is deepened by an alliance between the powerful drug smuggling clans and the military leadership which is conducting the dirty war.  in the santa fe ii document, formulating future united states policy in latin america, it is even said that unless the united states intervenes in the 1990's colombia will become another el salvador and on a much larger scale.  the so-called extermination operation, also known as the condor plan, is directed against the communist party and up, against the unions, but also against priests who preach liberation theology, and recently this has intensified.  in colombia some elements of fascism openly manifest themselves.  this is manifested in huge and unpunished massacres and in the powerlessness of president barco and his civilian ministers who are not managing to keep the military leadership in check, although the president is the supreme commander of the armed forces.    (posledni) sometimes partisans are also accused of terror.      (cepeda) that is one of the traits of american policy -- to term any kind of revolutionary struggle, of struggle for democracy, and the people's movement as terrorism.  therefore, it also labels the sandinistas in nicaragua as terrorists and the contra rebels as freedom fighters.  by this i do not want to say that the partisans do not make mistakes, we also criticize them.  for example, we condemned the destruction of oil piplines by the colombian partisan organization the national liberation army (eln). we do not agree with kidnapping civilians in exchange for ransom.  we announced that, as long as it is impossible to end the conflict, it is necessary to humanize it and to respect human lives.  these are the tactics of soldiers -- to label the partisans as terrorists and then massacre the civilian population as suspects who are collaborating with terrorism.    (posledni) partisans from the revolutionary armed forces of colombia (farc) offered the government a dialogue about a truce.  how do they want to conduct this?    (cepeda) the farc, which is the strongest element of the colombian partisan movement and a member of its coordinating committee, unilaterally adopted a cease-fire and proposed the creation of a commission for this dialogue.  in it are two former presidents, the liberal lopez michelsen and the conservative pastrana, the chairman of the association of industrialists echeverri correa, and bogota's cardinal rebollo.  the farc wants the government to disband the paramilitary groups.  the former interior minister, gaviria, said that there are 140 of them.  this means that the government knows them.  the farc is demanding the purge of people from the army command involved in the dirty war, that the defense minister be a civilian, that the state of emergency be revoked, and that the road to real democracy be opened.    (posledni) but the government has begun negotiating with partisans from m-19.    (cepeda) the el tiempo newspaper reported that the government promised them representation in parliament by their inclusion as candidates of the liberal party.  this is to involve four seats as long as m-19 lays down its arms and disbands.  the other partisans bitterly criticized this as a blow against the unity of the movement which will be abused for propaganda purposes.  at the same time, m-19 represents only 5 percent of the movement.  it is the intention of the government to divide the partisans.    (posledni) the colombian communist party congress took place in december.  how did it react to the situation?    (cepeda) the party called for peace and outlined the struggle for a pluralist government of transition towards peace and democracy.  at the end of february there was a central committee session which discussed the dirty war.  it stated that, in spite of the terror, there had not been what had happened in similar situations in other latin american countries, namely, mass emigration.  to ensure that this does not happen in the future, the central committee discussed new measures, including the transition of part of the party to the underground.  we will not all transfer, because now we must struggle for open contact with the masses, regardless of the huge risk which is linked to this.    (posledni) where is the party seeking allies?      (cepeda) comrade antequera, as deputy chairman of the up, had established a number of contacts.  however, he was murdered, and senator samper pisano, a politician from the ruling liberal party, was seriously injured during the assassination at bogota airport on 3 march.  the assassination attempt against the 32-year-old prospective politician occurred the day after he announced his candidacy for the presidency.  he announced his support for democratic coexistence, for an end to the dirty war which, as he said, is not in the interest of the colombian people.  therefore, he was not a chance victim.  it is also significant that the closed circuit television covering the airport, which is in the hands of the army, was switched off.  thus, they wanted to prevent the murderers being filmed.  one of them died, they let the other three escape.  at the same time, bogota's chief of police was at the airport along with another 10 colonels and a number of policemen and personal bodyguards.    (posledni) how did the other parties react to the assassination?    (cepeda) a joint document was signed by the colombian communist  party, the up, and the liberal party, on whose behalf the former president turbay ayala signed.  it demands that the government disband the paramilitary squads.  it shows that opinions are beginning to differ, even in the ruling liberal party.  the conservatives are also emphatically criticizing the bloodbath and the passivity of the government, pointing out that their last president, betancur, conducted a dialogue with the partisans.  this is all happening before the elections which will take place next year.    (posledni) the colombian communist party leadership met with the president after the murder of comrade forero.  what was that about?    (cepeda) in the conversation, we pointed to the fact that the defense minister, general guerrero paz, travels around colombia accompanied by the leader of the ultra-right wing, retired general landazabal reyes, who is leader of the paramilitary groups.  we asked why these two are together. the president did not answer us.  at the meeting we also said that, unless the dirty war stops, the colombian communist party for the first time in history will not take part in the elections.  we will not be able to participate, because we are all being murdered.  unless the government gives us a guarantee of security, we will not sacrifice more lives.

(cepeda) comrade antequera, as deputy chairman of the up, had established a number of contacts.  however, he was murdered, and senator samper pisano, a politician from the ruling liberal party, was seriously injured during the assassination at bogota airport on 3 march.  the assassination attempt against the 32-year-old prospective politician occurred the day after he announced his candidacy for the presidency.  he announced his support for democratic coexistence, for an end to the dirty war which, as he said, is not in the interest of the colombian people.  therefore, he was not a chance victim.  it is also significant that the closed circuit television covering the airport, which is in the hands of the army, was switched off.  thus, they wanted to prevent the murderers being filmed.  one of them died, they let the other three escape.  at the same time, bogota's chief of police was at the airport along with another 10 colonels and a number of policemen and personal bodyguards.    (posledni) how did the other parties react to the assassination?    (cepeda) a joint document was signed by the colombian communist  party, the up, and the liberal party, on whose behalf the former president turbay ayala signed.  it demands that the government disband the paramilitary squads.  it shows that opinions are beginning to differ, even in the ruling liberal party.  the conservatives are also emphatically criticizing the bloodbath and the passivity of the government, pointing out that their last president, betancur, conducted a dialogue with the partisans.  this is all happening before the elections which will take place next year.    (posledni) the colombian communist party leadership met with the president after the murder of comrade forero.  what was that about?    (cepeda) in the conversation, we pointed to the fact that the defense minister, general guerrero paz, travels around colombia accompanied by the leader of the ultra-right wing, retired general landazabal reyes, who is leader of the paramilitary groups.  we asked why these two are together. the president did not answer us.  at the meeting we also said that, unless the dirty war stops, the colombian communist party for the first time in history will not take part in the elections.  we will not be able to participate, because we are all being murdered.  unless the government gives us a guarantee of security, we will not sacrifice more lives.    (posledni) thank you for the interview.",

(begin recording) (perez beltran) to this moment, and due to the seriousness of the case, i do not dare to admit the existance of any relationship between these two terrorist groups. if the shining path is operating in bolivia, it should announce that it is in fact shining path that is committing these crimes.    we can say the same thing about the national liberation army in the 1960's, when it did not hide its identity. this was an international group. they arrived in bolivia without hiding their international identity, and there are many bolivians who can tell us about the national liberation army.    now, if this crime was committed by the shining path, then it was committed by the shining path and not by the zarate wilka group. i do not want to discard this possibility, however, i do not want to admit it as something verified and confirmed. our obligation, as members of the executive branch, is to release the results of something obvious, fully verified and confirmed. (end recording)    the interior minister added that the existence of the self-styled fal-zarate wilka group and of shining path members in bolivia is doubtful, because in the criminal cases recorded in cochabamba and in oruro recently, the police discovered that common criminals, and especially those linked to the world of drug addition and drug trafficking were directly involved in those crimes.    regarding the murder of the two missionaries in la paz last wednesday, the interior minister stated that no one has been detained, but that the investigations by the intelligence services continue.    (begin recording) (reporter) (question indistinct)     (perez beltran) no. we cannot suppose the existence of a terrorist group in bolivia.      (reporter) and what about these murder cases?    (perez beltran) i do not know. many people can be hiding behind this zarate wilka group. we do not know anything about this zarate wilka group. we do not know anything about their political leanings, or what party is behind this group. this could have been a common crime, or maybe not.    but we cannot just go out and say: yes, this group last night machinegunned these people, that they escaped, etc. this would mean a very irresponsible behavior. the executive branch wants to deal with this case as seriously as possible and not cause the people to panic.    we must do something for the country. we should unite our forces, all coalition parties, the ruling party, the executive branch, the armed forces, the national police, and all bolivians, to defend our democracy. this would represent a real bolivian struggle against those who intend to disrupt our process of liberty, to fight for the future of our children and of the fatherland.

            "doc": "when we asked the foreign ministry why the honduran government has not protested the salvadoran armed forces attacks on honduran army soldiers and a helicopter in los llanitos (intibuca), the answer was very simple, but it shows the importance that is given to national sovereignty and integrity: the armed forces have not informed us of anything at all -- they said -- and what the media says is not accurate.    the newspapers tiempo and la prensa published reports of the incident with photographs that confirmed the aggression, the bombing and shelling of villages in our territory, and provided accounts by eyewitnesses and municipal authorities, but which, according to the foreign ministry, lack credibility or importance.    later foreign newsmen went to these places and confirmed what tiempo and la prensa had reported.  they also obtained other details on the incidents. while the honduran and salvadoran armed forces denied the incident, despite the evidence, the truth is there for the gentlemen of the foreign ministry to see.    according to statements by the villagers who were the victims of the salvadoran aggression, the honduran military threatened them and ordered them to be silent or to lie about what had happened.  it was necessary for the santa lucia mayor to intervene before they could tell newsmen what had happened.  a reporter for la prensa was sidetracked by a commander, no doubt to keep him from doing his job as a journalist.    the honduran army's weapons served to keep the aggression quiet instead of repelling it, to threaten honduran border villagers instead of protecting them, while the army turned its back on the enemy armed forces -- which have trampled on our territory and humiliated us -- instead of fighting them.  in short, the weapons that we hondurans and the armed forces have obtained with so much sacrifice, even at the expense of going without food and medicine, are used against honduras and its people.      this situation should cause us to give much thought to the existence of the honduran armed forces.  we anticipated this when the regional military training and security center (crems) was created exclusively to train 10,000 salvadoran troops -- the same army that invaded us in 1969 and that is attacking us again.    we wonder if we are not acquiring a mercenary mentality in honduras, whereby the state's weapons go to the highest bidder rather than being used in the national interest.  for the past 7 years they have been used for economic -- though ideologically disguised -- benefits.    no national military force can function like this anywhere in the world. in any event, the ideology of any army should be nationalistic, even in the case of powers and superpowers that invent and use internationalist ideologies for their hegemonic struggles.    here in honduras the case of the armed forces is just the opposite.  to the military institute's way of thinking, those who are demanding the defense of sovereignty and territorial integrity are subversives who are allied with subversives from other countries.  an aggression against honduras by a foreign army is legitimized by the people attacked and those who inform and protest are enemies of the fatherland.    this was stated in an editorial of the honduran armed forces' \"military projections\" program.  the editorial said that the report was issued \"without prior investigation\" and was based solely \"on information provided by these groups to confuse national and international public opinion.\"    \"the irresponsibility of some print and broadcast media directors has reached the point that they are promoting these clearly marxist - leninist subversives, financed by cuba and nicaragua, and those who do not hide their open sympathy with pseudo-professional positions.  they attempt to conceal this by claiming that radio stations or newspapers have unrestricted freedom of expression.\"    a similar explanation was presented by the salvadoran embassy in tegucigalpa in a press communique distributed to the media, which published and disseminated it -- although it appears incredible -- through the official presidential house bulletins.  we might add that the honduran army has echoed such reports, as an accomplice to a propaganda ploy to cover up an aggression against our country.    we ask, therefore:  \"what is left of our national institutions?  what is honduras?  who are hondurans?\"",

(begin recording) (custodio) we have called this news conference because we want to warn the people, the foreign journalists who are here, and the other central american presidents about the atmosphere of insecurity which afflicts the honduran people.    first of all, we will mention the assassinations which occurred in july at san pedro sula: eduardo herrera, salomon vallecillo, and dr ramon roberto garay.  we believe that the assassinations were perpetrated by professionals so we would like a judge to call the new commander of battalion 3-16 -- now called counterinsurgency battalion -- colonel alberto andino benitez to testify.  there are reports that a member of the 3-16th battalion contacted salomon vallecillo prior to his death.    likewise, i want to mention how the citizenry is exposed to police brutality.  there is the case of justo pastor escobar silva, who was assassinated by a fusep (public security forces) agent who is now serving a prison sentence.    furthermore, people feel insecure in the country, and i will mention a case which occurred 3 weeks ago.  dr marco antonio bogran was taken with all his household employees to the dni (department of national investigation) and held from 0800 to 1500.  he was not allowed to call his lawyer or his relatives, and he was held in isolation.  he was naturally afraid the worst would happen.  no one explained anything until the end.  he was told that someone had reportedly made a subversive phone call from his house.  this means that his telephone is being illegally tapped because no one here has the right to control anyone's calls. the military men in charge of hondutel (honduran telecommunications enterprise) illegally abuse their power when they hear and control telephone calls because this should be handled by the civilian authorities.  (passage omitted) (end recording)    colonel manuel enrique suarez benavides, chief of the armed forces public relations office, has reacted to custodio lopez' statement.    (begin recording) (col suarez) i have heard part of ramon custodio's news conference on codeh foreign policy, and we observed his animosity toward the contras and his affection for the farabundo marti national liberation front in el salvador.  we thought he only handled human rights but we see he also delves in foreign policy. however, this is not the main issue.    i want to refer to the fact that years ago we publicly proved that battalion 3-16, which he mentioned so many times, had been dismantled so the unit no longer exists.  nevertheless, he seems to have forgotten this, or he may be intentionally forgetting this.  the unit disappeared but the counterintelligence battalion he mentions does exist and its commander, which he mentions, is a member of the armed forces.  in other words, he has absolutely nothing to do with the activities that battalion 3-16 reportedly carried out.  if custodio wants it, we can send him a copy of the agreements to dismantle battalion 3-16 and to appoint the current commander of the counterintelligence battalion, which has existed for many years.  that is all.  i wanted to clarify this and i hope dr custodio is more objective in his statements.  i sometimes believe that the problem of being on one side (words indistinct) the mind.    (reporter) colonel, when will the armed forces be able to give the honduran people exact information on the latest people who have been reported missing in our country?    (col suarez) excuse me, i can hardly hear you.    (reporter) i asked: when can the honduran people have exact information on the people who have been reported missing in the country?    (col suarez) look, we believe that we will shortly, and i am talking about a short time, have enough information for the honduran people on the persons you have mentioned because the investigations continue.  the police arrest people based on the suspicion or hard, rational evidence that they are involved in criminal actions.  i believe you will soon have enough information on the persons who have been arrested by the police.

            "doc": "ramon custodio lopez, president of the human rights defense committee (codeh) has predicted that the tela summit will be chaotic because, in his opinion, the honduran and salvadoran governments will interfere.  the codeh president also revealed that the battalion 3-16's new name is the counterinsurgency battalion and its commander is colonel alberto andino benitez.  custodio said this during the news conference he held 2 august.    (begin recording) (custodio) we have called this news conference because we want to warn the people, the foreign journalists who are here, and the other central american presidents about the atmosphere of insecurity which afflicts the honduran people.    first of all, we will mention the assassinations which occurred in july at san pedro sula: eduardo herrera, salomon vallecillo, and dr ramon roberto garay.  we believe that the assassinations were perpetrated by professionals so we would like a judge to call the new commander of battalion 3-16 -- now called counterinsurgency battalion -- colonel alberto andino benitez to testify.  there are reports that a member of the 3-16th battalion contacted salomon vallecillo prior to his death.    likewise, i want to mention how the citizenry is exposed to police brutality.  there is the case of justo pastor escobar silva, who was assassinated by a fusep (public security forces) agent who is now serving a prison sentence.    furthermore, people feel insecure in the country, and i will mention a case which occurred 3 weeks ago.  dr marco antonio bogran was taken with all his household employees to the dni (department of national investigation) and held from 0800 to 1500.  he was not allowed to call his lawyer or his relatives, and he was held in isolation.  he was naturally afraid the worst would happen.  no one explained anything until the end.  he was told that someone had reportedly made a subversive phone call from his house.  this means that his telephone is being illegally tapped because no one here has the right to control anyone's calls. the military men in charge of hondutel (honduran telecommunications enterprise) illegally abuse their power when they hear and control telephone calls because this should be handled by the civilian authorities.  (passage omitted) (end recording)    colonel manuel enrique suarez benavides, chief of the armed forces public relations office, has reacted to custodio lopez' statement.    (begin recording) (col suarez) i have heard part of ramon custodio's news conference on codeh foreign policy, and we observed his animosity toward the contras and his affection for the farabundo marti national liberation front in el salvador.  we thought he only handled human rights but we see he also delves in foreign policy. however, this is not the main issue.    i want to refer to the fact that years ago we publicly proved that battalion 3-16, which he mentioned so many times, had been dismantled so the unit no longer exists.  nevertheless, he seems to have forgotten this, or he may be intentionally forgetting this.  the unit disappeared but the counterintelligence battalion he mentions does exist and its commander, which he mentions, is a member of the armed forces.  in other words, he has absolutely nothing to do with the activities that battalion 3-16 reportedly carried out.  if custodio wants it, we can send him a copy of the agreements to dismantle battalion 3-16 and to appoint the current commander of the counterintelligence battalion, which has existed for many years.  that is all.  i wanted to clarify this and i hope dr custodio is more objective in his statements.  i sometimes believe that the problem of being on one side (words indistinct) the mind.    (reporter) colonel, when will the armed forces be able to give the honduran people exact information on the latest people who have been reported missing in our country?    (col suarez) excuse me, i can hardly hear you.    (reporter) i asked: when can the honduran people have exact information on the people who have been reported missing in the country?    (col suarez) look, we believe that we will shortly, and i am talking about a short time, have enough information for the honduran people on the persons you have mentioned because the investigations continue.  the police arrest people based on the suspicion or hard, rational evidence that they are involved in criminal actions.  i believe you will soon have enough information on the persons who have been arrested by the police.

            "doc": "according to western diplomats, colombian drug traffickers have moved to guatemala in search of new supply routes, bringing instability to a country that is experiencing a wave of violence from various sectors.    the diplomats believe that up to 200 colombians linked to the medellin and cali cartels are now operating in guatemala and that about 500 kg of cocaine pass every week through the country, essentially enroute to the u.s. market.    the increasing drug trafficking activity coincides with a new wave of kidnappings, bombings, and murders in guatemala, awakening fears that the country will return to the violence prevalent at the beginning of the decade, when thousands were killed by death squads during military regimes.    since august, a prominent politician, a well-known banker, and at least five university students have been murdered.  several bombs have exploded in the capital in recent months and students and human rights activists are missing.    \"all of this violence cannot be blamed on a (words indistinct), but the increase of drug trafficking is clearly an additional concern.\"    in addition to the cocaine, which the diplomats say is taken to the united states aboard light planes or in automobiles through mexico and texas, u.s. officials have reported an increase in opium production in guatemala.  according to estimates, the number of hectares planted went from 225 in 1985 to 1,500 this year.    there are insistent rumors that banker ramiro castillo love was murdered outside his house on 25 august because he refused to launder drug money.  there is open talk in the capital about important politicians being linked to drug trafficking.    nevertheless, the diplomats say that there is no evidence to back such speculation and they add that it is very likely that several interests are working to destabilize the country's fragile democracy.    \"it seems as if several strings are being pulled at the same time,\" a diplomat said.    while christian democratic president vinicio cerezo has given guatemala a respite, after decades of military regimes during which it is believed that more than 100,000 people were killed as a result of political violence, it is estimated that approximately 1,200 leftist guerrillas are still fighting in the mountains.    furthermore, the country has faced two coup attempts since democracy was restored in 1986.    the ultra-right-wing, with its ties to the land-owning oligarchy, continues to be a powerful force in the country.  it has blocked a majority of reforms that cerezo has tried to introduce and, according to the general consensus, it has promoted discontent among the armed forces' mid-level officers.    \"the ultra-right-wing is undoubtedly behind part of the violence,\" said a diplomat.  \"it could be trying to force the government to overreact or cause the army to get involved.\"    as if to confirm this, a police arrest warrant has been issued against former presidential candidate lionel sisniega, a noted politician who leans to the right and has been involved in coup attempts since 1954, on charges of heading a group responsible for much of the violence in the country.    diplomats have also pointed to the resurgence of activities by left-wing guerrillas who have been struggling to topple successive governments over the past 2 decades.    \"nowadays they are using much more obvious tactics, erecting barricades on highways and occupying small towns near the capital,\" one diplomat said.    fear that the violence of the seventies will return may also contribute toward a resurgence in the number of illegal immigrants that cross over to mexico.    mexican authorities say that the number of undocumented central americans deported to guatemala has doubled over the past few months.    the diplomats feel that cerezo's government will weather the violence and pass it onto his successor after the presidential elections scheduled for november 1990.    \"perhaps the situation is the result of the preparation for elections in guatemala,\" a diplomat said.  \"things will probably worsen next year.\"",

(de greiff) the decrees were being studied since noon on the day of his death.  it had been a very tough week.  the magistrate and the colonel had been murdered; galan was murdered that evening.  there was much discussion over the drafts, but i believe that the attack on galan hurried things up.    in the case of the extradition decree, we were all aware that it was not a popular measure.  philosophically, most ministers did not like the idea of colombians being tried abroad.  there was much legal discussion, not only to do with this case, but also over the new measures concerning raids, seizures, and arrests.    however, finally there was a great determination to give the country answers.    (reporter) the country's current problems have much to do with the extradition decree.    (de greiff) we must not forget that these measures are not against a group of people, but against violence.  extradition has been a very tough measure for everyone.  the inconveniences and the legality of this decree, as well as the possible reactions against it, were discussed a great deal.  it can be that part of the violence generated has been due to the extradition decree.    (reporter) is it possible to begin a dialogue with the drug traffickers as a way of ending the country's violence?    (de greiff) the government said no to the dialogue, but we must wait and see how events develop.  i do not believe that a government's decision can be strict, because situations do change.  the president has said that dialogue is impossible.  you never know, things may change in the future.    anyway, in colombia practically no wars have ended, because in nearly all wars an agreement was reached.    (reporter) but if colombia holds a dialogue, the world's doors will probably close on colombia.    (de greiff) look, in the united states i was asked about the extradition and i said it was not popular, that it was not going to solve the drug trafficking problem.  it is not the government's stance, but if it is decided to hold a dialogue, then this would be a sovereign colombian decision.  obviously, if the position changes a bad impression will be given.    the government has been very clear that it has not lost its sovereignty.    (reporter) the internatinal press feels a little disappointed with your resignation.  one must not forget that you became a symbol for the foreign journalists when you traveled to washington.    (de greiff) i held a news conference on 22 september and i told them that my resignation was not monica de greiff's position, but the government's.  i told them i was staying in the country, and i explained to them that the ministers here remain at their posts until the president decides otherwise.  however, they did not understand why.    (reporter) what will monica de greiff do?    (de greiff) i am going to rest for a few days and then return.  i am going to help ernesto samper's campaign.  i also believe that working for private enterprise will be a good opportunity.    (reporter) what post has given you the greatest satisfaction?    (de greiff) when i was at the ministry of mines and energy. it was fascinating.  i had two very good bosses: guillermo perry and oscar mejia.  i worked in delightful harmony with a group of good people.  i believe that mining and hydrocarbons is the sector that has enjoyed the greatest progress under this government.    (reporter) what is your final feeling upon leaving the ministry?

(applause)    i am also here at the united nations to present to you the crude reality of this war against drug trafficking.  colombia is on the frontline of this battle.  for us it is not a war of words.  many colombians have died because of their firm commitment against drug trafficking.  approximately 1 month ago, luis carlos galan, one of the most prestigious political leaders in my country, was assassinated. his death has consolidated even more the nation's will and has drawn the world's attention to the problem.  however, many colombians have died over the years -- as he did -- as victim of drug trafficking. that long list includes 12 magistrates of the supreme court, an attorney general, and a justice minister.  prominent congressmen, judges, mayors, journalists, thousands of soldiers, policemen, and colombian citizens have given their lives for democracy.    last month, after announcing exceptional measures against drug trafficking, which were decreed by the government in accordance with the state of siege, drug traffickers have continued and intensified their terrorist actions.

(begin recording) (cristiani) the last straw is that terrorists, without any risk to themselves, kill defenseless women.  this particular lady was accompanied by her children, one of whom was wounded.  we think this is the limit.  we are not sure who did it, but, considering the nature of the action, it appears to be a terrorist crime.  we already know who perpetrates such actions.  we think this is part of what the fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front) has been doing.  they have been silencing voices that uphold philosophies that run contrary to their's.  (end recording)    referring to the presence of pastor ribrejo in the country, cristiani said the un official will be able to confirm that the policy of the salvadoran government and armed forces does not fit the violation of the human rights.    (begin recording) (cristiani) i will not refer to monsignor arturo rivera y damas alone, but to all of the organizations linked to the fmln that have been trying to discredit the government.  i think dr ribrejo will be able to confirm that neither the government nor the armed forces are in the habit of violating human rights.  i think if one tries to be objective and realistic, he will realize that the fmln has been trying to make the homeland fall into a state of total anarchy. i think the armed forces have acted very professionally.  the government's policy has been to try to seek solutions through reason rather than violence.  these events must be seen in the light of what the fmln said it would do.  it said it would unleash even greater violence. (end recording)    as for the upcoming dialogue meeting to be held in san jose on 16 and 17 october, cristiani said a commission is ready to resume talks with the fmln, to which a cease-fire will be proposed, among other things. cristiani said that the costa rican government has reported working on the logistics of the meeting so the talks can be held in peace.",

(begin recording) (government minister carlos lemos) the government must decide if there is a treaty with the united states or not before it enforces the extradition through administrative channels.  (end recording)    nevertheless, the court's ruling does not end the extraditions to the united states because, even though the court believes that an extradition treaty is still in effect with that country -- the one signed in 1888 -- and that it should be enforced instead of  resorting to extraditions through administrative channels, the government clearly says there is no extradition treaty with the united states.    (begin recording) (government minister carlos lemos) the 1979 treaty had been annulled by the supreme court of justice, but according to the state council, that treaty replaced -- so to speak -- the 1933 treaty signed in montevideo and the 1888 treaty.  therefore, things are now the same as yesterday or the day before.

            "doc": "commander leonel gonzalez, on friday night mr alfredo cristiani announced some measures which the government will adopt in connection with fenastras (salvadoran workers national union federation) and the dialogue.  the fmln announced it had suspended its trip to caracas, but cristiani said that the government commission will go to caracas regardless of our decision.  what is your opinion on the government's decision?    (gonzalez) in my opinion, two positions on the dialogue and the negotiations process were made evident in san jose.  the government of alfredo cristiani and the armed forces high command view the dialogue as an opportunity for talking, buying time, and building a good image for themselves.  on the other hand, the fmln is working for a real negotiations process.  the fmln has opened a broader debate, a debate that includes discussions with and the participation of political parties, the social forces, the church, all the sectors. we have initiated a national dialogue.  as we see it, the goal is part of a whole, it is not everything.  the entire process of allowing the participation of the social forces is important also.    in recent days we have seen actions unprecedented in the history of el salvador.  there was the attack on workers in which 10 workers died and 31 were injured.  the fmln cannot ignore this fact.  this is part of the process.  we have said that we are going to establish contact with observers and mediators to analyze the situation, and we will discuss this process with the political parties and the social forces. what we want is to consolidate the negotiations process.  we are not trying to enhance our image; our people know who is telling the truth.    in san jose we made a solution proposal that envisages democracy, human rights, and a process to find a way out of the salvadoran conflict.  on monday and wednesday of next week we are going to meet in washington with oas and un representatives.  also on monday in san jose, costa rica, we could be in contact with the costa rican government to analyze the situation.    we will analyze developments to determine the position of the cristiani government.  if actions by the cristiani government close the possibilities of caracas, then we will adopt measures.  what we have done is to announce a suspension to create conditions for making progress toward real negotiations, as the san jose agreements establish.    (reporter) then why is the government going to caracas, commander?    (gonzalez) i believe that the announcement on the government delegation going to caracas is aimed at enhancing the government's  image, at creating a smoke screen around the massacre committed against the popular movement.    (reporter) now that you mention the fenastras massacre, what do you think about the creation of a commission to investigate this case that cristiani has announced?    (gonzalez) one of the points of our san jose proposal calls for changing the salvadoran legal system because it is vitiated and is in the hands of one single party.  so, in this framework, conducting an investigation is like putting the case inside a forgotten drawer. this is what happened to the monsignor romero case, the case of the revolutionary democratic front leaders, and the cases of thousands of workers who have been murdered and whose cases have been forgotten. the purpose of this commission is to create a smoke screen around the grave human rights violations being committed by the cristiani government.  we believe that the persons who have been invited to form part of this commission should not lend themselves to playing a part in the effort to hide what is really behind all this.  what the cristiani government wants is to divert away from emilio ponce all the accusations and charges, and ponce is the one who is directly involved in this kind of attack.  the state policy of the cristiani government is repression, and this state policy is being implemented by the cristiani government, cristiani, and the high command, and they are doing it through the repressive bodies, regardless of whether they function as civilians, as death squads, or in uniform.

(salvatierra) it is basically aimed at saving cristiani's prestige and image, as this has been a matter of great concern for the u.s. government from the beginning. they need a potable image, an image that portrays legitimacy, and an image of moderation that will not isolate the government internationally. the fenastras incident undoubtedly unmasked cristiani's government. therefore, aronson's visit is aimed at saving cristiani's image and supporting cristiani's initiative of creating a commission to investigate those incidents, in order to foster hopes and credibility among some groups regarding the government's interest in clarifying the incidents. that was aronson's intention.    as a matter of fact, cristiani's image is important for the aid itself. aspects related to human rights play a very important role in the debates at the u.s. congress, where the aid is approved. therefore, that aid would be endangered if the debates on violations of human rights in el salvador are intensified. it could have an effect on that. so what they are really trying to save is the aid to continue supporting the war.    in that regard, we must also remember that within the doctrine of low intensity warfare, the political aspects of the counterinsurgency plan play an important role (words indistinct) that will not appear to be in the extreme right; a government that appears to be more in the center than in the extreme right, in order to create expectations within some groups regarding the government's credibility, and also at the international level. while trying to defeat the rebels militarily and through repression, it is necessary to maintain an acceptable image of the government.

(end recording)    regarding the visit to el salvador of bernard aronson, assistant secretary of state for inter-american affairs, commander jorge shafik handal said:    (begin recording) (handal) the heads of the armed forces and military units who carried out these crimes remain in office.  those who gave the orders remain in office.  then how can an investigation be carried out?  a chain of command must be followed in the military. if a subordinate is going to be interrogated, one must first ask permission from his superior, and they are the superiors.  besides, no one knows who the subordinates who participated are.  that information must come from the army.  that is why we have said that the least they can do before they begin investigating this incident is remove colonel rene emilio ponce.  that would be the right thing to do.  i would even add that there are a few others who should be removed.    if we were living in a country with a democratic political system and with labor unions, that would be common practice.  it would not even be necessary to bring this up at a public debate.  the first thing the president should have done as commander in chief of the armed forces -- he is involved in these crimes because he is commander in chief of the armed forces -- is remove them and not say that he was not consulted on this matter.  he claims he knew nothing about this, but we have our own sources of information and we know that he knew. but if he wants us to believe him when he says that he did not know, then the first thing he should do is what any man with any self-respect would do: ask for an investigation.  however, he is hindering the investigation, which is what is always done when something like this happens.  when things like this happen, a few -- those who want to see matters clarified -- resign, while others are removed.

            "doc": "good evening, salvadoran people--if i may say, so despite the circumstances affecting the capital city. it is regrettable and inconceivable that the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) should persist with the aggression it has unleashed against our capital city and surrounding municipalities. our population has suffered the most from this fmln aggression.    this aggression, salvadoran friends, must be seen as an act of desperation by the fmln, as this is the only way we can explain their irrational actions. i have used the word desperation because the fmln knows that it is out of style and that its attitudes are no longer accepted in the world. we can see in europe that countries have passed from totalitarian regimes such as the one that the fmln wants to implement here, and walls are open for liberty and democracy.    we are sure that this is what the salvadoran people want: liberty and democracy. that is why they have not supported and will never support the fmln terrorists who want to subject the salvadoran people to totalitarian regimes, to dictatorships of oppression, repression, and violation of human rights.    i was saying that this is a desperate act because we cannot see how anyone who is not desperate could cause so much harm to innocent people and to the civilian population. there are already more than 100 dead or wounded because of the fmln's irrational actions. of course, to that we must add that they destroyed many homes which they entered and have held families as hostages. they have damaged the electricity, potable water, and telephone systems, depriving the population of those essential services, not to mention the lack of food affecting the civilian population in the areas where they are holding hostages.    in addition, it is appropriate to see how far the fmln terrorists' irrational minds can go, because they have carried out acts of savagery that we cannot understand. how can there still be anyone like the nicaraguans--and i am talking about the nicaraguan government, of course, not all nicaraguans--and the cubans, who support such acts of savagery.    holding civilians as hostages, putting them in the middle so that they will be the ones who are hurt, and shielding themselves behind innocent people is an act of savagery, salvadoran people.    taking over a center for orphan children in order to protect themselves behind little children who do not have a father or a mother is an act of savagery, salvadoran people.    they even did something worse at the zacatecoluca hospital and the people witnessed this. when they entered the hospital in zacatecoluca, they murdered, at gunpoint, a soldier who was receiving medical attention; they placed bombs inside the hospital and then fled.    salvadoran people: the fmln is already a desperate beast. this is  the only thing we can say about such irrational minds. however, we must realize and understand, and above all, be sure that the majority of our people repudiate the fmln terrorists.                        the people must know that they can count on their armed forces which have advanced slowly, but surely. it is advancing slowly because it wants to fully protect the lives of civilians. the armed forces could drive those terrorists out of where they are; however, there are civilians there, and we would never want to expose those civilians to the danger the fmln is trying to lead them into.  the armed forces have continued to advance. they have effectively advanced, using professional means. for example, neighborhoods such as bosques del rio are totally calm now, because the armed forces have already entered and forced the terrorists out. we know that all of you would like to see an end to this terror that the fmln wants to create. however, we must also understand, particularly those of us who are not as anguished at this moment as those families that have become fmln hostages. they too, deserve that we do everything we can to achieve our objective; however, we must do so respecting the lives of those innocent people. the fmln failed to achieve its objective.

(words indistinct) the u.s. ambassador, the u.s. advisers, the bush administration, and who knows who else were informed about this plan. they made the wrong interpretation of the calls made by the international red cross and other humanitarian organizations on the need to have a truce to evacuate civilians.  they thought that we made these calls and based on that, they felt that they could proceed to a counteroffensive.    based on that, let us analyze the propaganda and information disseminated on the day prior to the killing of the jesuits.  the u.s. ambassador himself explained a war report and gave an update on the situation.  thus, they thought that the fmln was going to suffer a great political and military defeat in the next few hours.  they had an overall plan.

(30-second break in reception) this situation so they did not protect themselves in the face of the danger of a possible action such as this crime.    on the same night when the entire northern san salvador area was being bombed, the jesuits were killed.  what was their intention? they thought they were to obtain a military victory and set out to carry out a witch hunt.  they set out to kill all opposition members that one night, with the idea that they were going to wipe out the fmln, militarily.  based on that assumption, they decided to carry out this action to guarantee for themselves a few more years of stability through the peace of cemeteries, regardless of the consequences.    what really happened?  the day after they committed the crime, they launched their offensive to annihilate the fmln.  they thought this was going to be their decisive day, but the offensive failed.  their attack was repelled, they sustained many casualties, and loss much materiel.  their troops were further beaten and they did not obtain any effective military results.    consequently, their counteroffensive was rejected and the blow they thought they were going to deal to the leaders of the popular movement failed, on the one hand because some of these leaders were hiding and on the other because they committed an horrendous crime and it backfired.  it was a crime (word indistinct) by the general staff and mr. cristiani knew about it.  cristiani clearly (words indistinct) and probably even the u.s. embassy could be involved in this.  they thought that by killing all opposition members, they were going to achieve definite peace in el salvador.  this is very clear.  but this action backfired.  it was a painful incident, but it is an incident that is going to backfire for the government.  it is going to result in great isolation for the regime, at a moment when the fmln is stronger.  at a moment when the fmln has a political, military, and strategic advantage.    the murder of the jesuits is suicide for the regime.  i really do not understand it.  they made a very serious mistake.  in addition, they confirmed a truth we have been maintaining: they are fascists and assassins.  they must leave power.  they have created a situation in which the possibility for an fmln victory is great.  they have created a situation in which the disappearance of the most conservative oligarchic sectors of the salvadoran society will be caused by their own mistakes.

(sentence as heard) president cerezo, the chief of the guatemalan general staff, and the guatemalan army official spokesman have already publicly expressed their solidarity and support for cristiani.    we vigorously condemn the interference of the guatemalan army against the glorious salvadoran people.  we call on all guatemalan groups to protest that interference.  we will make the guatemalan government and army pay a very high price for this aggression against the fraternal salvadoran people.    we warn the world that a genocide larger than the one which has already occurred is being conducted in el salvador now.  we are sure the salvadoran people will defeat all their enemies; that they will be the winners of this historic struggle, and that they will achieve their goals.    the blood that has been shed will turn into new life.  the salvadoran people will undoubtedly achieve their goals of freedom, democracy, and peace.    guatemala, 17 november 1989    urng general command    (signed) commander rolando moran    commander gaspar ilom    commander pablo monsanto    carlos gonzalez, pgt (guatemalan labor party) secretary general",

(reporter) a question from radio sandino.  first of all, since you got a first- hand view, what is the current situation in el salvador; second, is this a provisional measure or will it be extended; how long will this measure last?    (lacayo) i cannot say how long it will last.  that is up to the government, and it will depend on the internal situation in the country.  regarding your first question, the situation is difficult. on a military level, the war continues; there is a good deal of misinformation by the salvadoran government and many international news agencies.  the truth is that the battle continues, there has been considerable physical destruction in many towns and neighborhoods on the outskirts of san salvador.  you know which towns are included: zacamil, ciudad delgado, soyapango, etc. this is the result of the indiscriminate bombings by the salvadoran air force.    (reporter) there is a report that somozist guards are fighting with the salvadoran army.  is there anything to this?    (lacayo) there are rumors to that effect.  some insurgent radio stations have reported it, and they have also mentioned troops from other central american governments.    (reporter) (question indistinct)    (lacayo) yes, but not with the persistence that prevails now.    (reporter) (question indistinct)    (lacayo) of course.  many telephone calls, surveillace by suspicious individuals and vehicles at the residence throughout the day, and especially direct threats by telephone.    (reporter) (question indistinct)    (lacayo) i would imagine they are salvadoran rightwing extremists, better known as death squads.  they began to selectively shoot people. there is the case of mrs norma girola de herrera, president of the womens institute, a very progressive institution.  mrs herera was very well known, and she was murdered under circumstances very similar to those of the assasination of the jesuits; on the same day.

(reporter) (question indistinct)    (lacayo) yes, that has been proven.    (reporter) (question indistinct)    (lacayo) they are waging a war which consists at times of maintaining positions, at other times of mobilizing.  on several occasions controlled areas ceased to be controlled but the war continues.

(samayoa) at the level of the u.s. people, there is a total repudiation of the fascist criminal government and of the salvadoran armed forces because of the bombings -- which have become a true genocide -- in various densely populated cities and neighborhoods in el salvador, as well as because of the assassinations perpetrated by the salvadoran army against the jesuit priests at the central american university (uca).  there have been very radical demonstrations expressing much indignation by various u.s. social sectors.  moreover, in some of those demonstrations, the police barricades were broken. important u.s. political personalities such as jesse jackson, one of the most prestigious leaders in the united states, participated in the demonstrations.  there have also been demonstrations in boston, chicago, new york, san francisco, and los angeles.  in at least 20 cities in the united states people have expressed all their repudiation and indignation over the cristiani government and the u.s. policy in el salvador.    since the assassination of the uca priests, a large number of important u.s. senators and representatives are saying that u.s. military aid to the salvadoran armed forces and government should be cut and suspended.  senator kennedy in particular made a very strong statement, saying the salvadoran armed forces' attitude simply expresses the failure of 10 years of u.s. policy -- which has been spent feeding, training, arming, and financing an armed force that carries out assassinations.  in addition to senator kennedy, there are many u.s. senators and congressmen who are requesting the total suspension of military aid to el salvador.  at this time, the cristiani government and armed forces have the highest level of repudiation in the united states in the past 10 years.  however, the u.s. government, (words indistinct) the state department, and the white house continue supporting the (salvadoran) criminal regime and giving it further emergency aid.    (reporter) comrade, yesterday we learned about articles published in the main u.s. newspapers the new york times and the washington post, which strongly question the government, specifically president cristiani, the chief of the fascist dictatorship.  what is the situation of the cristiani speech and his alleged legitimacy, not only in the united states but also at the level of the european community?    (samayoa) the alleged legitimacy of cristiani collapsed.  in the united states, they said cristiani was (words indistinct) had good intentions, but the right-wing (words indistinct) and the death squads did not let him work.  the speech failed because it is now clear that as commander in chief of the armed forces, cristiani is responsible for the genocide in san salvador and other departments in the country (words indistinct).  the media have also reported the arrest of u.s. religious men and of swiss, french, spanish, and japanese citizens. the salvadoran government is a government accusing everyone of cooperating with the guerrillas, and this has caused a total loss of the government's prestige. editorials on 18 november in the main u.s. newspapers (words indistinct) cristiani is not more than (words indistinct). at embassies and consulates in most countries in western europe -- in italy, spain, the frg, france, sweden, denmark and everywhere -- there have been demonstrations called by labor unions, political parties, and people's movements in those countries to express repudiation.  in london, one of the most prestigious human rights organizations, amnesty international, urged everyone to stage demonstrations in front of all salvadoran embassies and consulates.

(reporter) to conclude, commander, the funeral rites for the the priests who were murdered in san salvador are taking place at this moment, around noon time, and alfredo cristiani and his wife are attending this ceremony.  do you have any message for the salvadoran people, for the students from the catholic university, for the christian people, for the people in general, who are mourning the death of these worthy jesuits?    (roca) we have already expressed, and i will reiterate it now, the deep sorrow of the fmln militants and the people in general over the loss of these worthy jesuit priests who have been consistent strugglers for democracy and peace in el salvador.  we share the feelings of the salvadoran religious community.    i would like to note that the presence of cristiani at the burial for the jesuit priests calls for a national and international outcry in demand for punishment for the persons responsible for this atrocious assassination.    cristiani cannot go to that burial and do nothing about people to whom he opened doors so that they could commit these killings. everybody must demand that cristiani respond to the people's indignation by punishing the persons responsible for the crime. cristiani cannot speak about having moral authority for attending that burial unless he punishes the people who are responsible.  it is not enough to punish the assassins.  there must be a thorough investigation of the wave of crime that has been unleashed in el salvador.  the most notorious crime has been the killing of the jesuit priests, but in the past 8 days many common people and community leaders have also been murdered.  the bombing has been intense.  the salvadoran people are enduring much pain and they demand that the people responsible for it be punished.    we again reiterate the pain of the people over the death of the jesuit priests.  we believe that the catholic church must bravely and loudly demand justice in the face of these crimes.",

            "doc": "a friend of the jesuit priests, the first to arrive on the scene, said that he counted some 500 or 600 bullet holes.  he said that these shots were fired from some distance, with a machinegun set up on a tripod.  the priests were also later shot in a garden nearby.  according to information that the society of jesus received following their own reconstruction of the crime, which they have released to the authorities investigating the case, the killers, approximately 30 men in uniform, arrived shortly before 0230.  they machinegunned the house before entering, dragged the priests out, put them in front of a wall that is still stained with blood, and shot them.  the priests were also shot in the head with a long-range weapon; however, these shots were fired from some distance.  a lawyer, helping in the investigation of this case and who has asked to remain unidentified, said that this was determined because there were no gunpowder marks on the victims.    at the time the crime was carried out, a curfew was being observed throughout the city.  (words indistinct) and the house where the priests lived was surrounded by soldiers.  together with this information, gathered by several institutions and prominent persons to prove that the murder was carried out by soldiers, we must stress that the house was also searched by the soldiers 2 days before the crime was committed.  a jesuit priest who was describing the scene said that only the area previously searched by the soldiers was destroyed.  he said that the library was burned and the rooms had been ransacked. according to the priest, $5,000 that father ignacio ellacuria had received in barcelona -- part of an award given the university -- were taken from one of the rooms.    the use of long-range weapons would also explain why the brains of the dead were scattered about.  this was seen by the first persons who arrived on the scene.  others said that the bodies were destroyed because ak-47 and m-16 assault rifles were used in the attack.  the bodies were so utterly destroyed that embalming was not possible. this was reported to acan-efe by society of jesus superior jose maria tojeira.    regarding the two murdered women, the cook elba julia ramos and her 15-year-old daughter marisela, all indicates that they were machinegunned in the small room where they slept. there was so much blood that it seeped under the door, and a vertebra and pieces of a skull can still be seen under a sofa in the small room.  the preliminary investigations seem to indicate that the victims were not tortured as earlier reports had stated.    meanwhile, salvadoran president alfredo cristiani reportedly said yesterday that the armed forces high command has not ruled out the possibility that the killers of the six jesuit priests could have been soldiers.  they have not ruled out the possibility that soldiers could have killed the priests, and they are determined to investigate the incident and punish the responsible parties.  this was said by the salvadoran president in statements to acan-efe and other foreign news agencies.  cristiani, who insisted on the need to avoid unfounded conclusions, added that the military does not think it will be affected by something done by individual members of the institution.    we can clearly see now that there are some contradictions.  at this moment there are three positions.  there is the position of u.s. ambassador william walker -- he is like an ostrich with its head buried in the sand.  there is proof that rules out all doubt.  how can 40 men in uniform be in a militarized area for 60 minutes and not hear shots being fired and bombs exploding?  why did the army not send in troops to find out what happened only a few blocks from colonel rene emilio ponce's office?  the 40 men were in the area for a whole hour. they had already searched father ellacuria's home.    our question for william walker: if this was not done by the armed forces, then why were they there searching the premises for a whole hour and even stealing $5,000?  they searched drawer by drawer.  the disorder they left behind was quite evident in the clips shown on television.  they searched the area for an hour to see what they, the murderers, could find to steal.  however, ambassador william walker says that he does not know if the army committed the crime.

(words indistinct) no doubt, and the international community has (words indistinct).  we do not believe in the government's investigations because we have past examples of it. we have monsignor romero's case and we have the case of the revolutionary democratic front leaders, who, a few years ago, were arrested in broad daylight during a police operation.  however, not a single soldier has been punished.  we do not believe in cristiani's justice.  the international community is putting on the pressure and cristiani will have to do something.  he will probably put up some act.  the u.s.  congress also has its eyes on el salvador.  they are debating the issue of aid to el salvador.  there is something else the u.s.  congress must think about.  the u.s. department of state said that it is pleased with the way cristiani acted in the face of the fmln offensive.  this means that the u.s. department of state has approved the dropping of white phosphorus over zacamil and the destruction of 500 homes.  this means that the u.s. department of state has approved the killing of the jesuit priests, and also the massacre of several salvadoran citizens who were taken from their homes and killed on the same black night when the jesuit priests were killed.",

(applause)    the truth is that we should feel proud.  as a nicaraguan i feel proud that that murderous government has broken relations with nicaragua.  that is something to be proud of, because it means that they know perfectly well that we are on the side of the salvadoran people, on the side of the salvadoran peasant, on the side of the salvadoran worker, on the side of the salvadoran church and priests, that we are on the side of peace, justice, and democracy in el salvador, and that we oppose tyranny in el salvador.    i can see that the time has come for me to speak clearly to you.  i believe that it is necessary to speak clearly because diplomatic jargon can sometimes confuse things.  it is time that we speak clearly.  the least the nicaraguan government can do in response to the attitude assumed by the salvadoran government is to ask and demand of the international community and the world that it break relations with that murderous and criminal government until those who killed the priests have been punished, until those who are killing the salvadoran people have been punished.  (applause) that is what we are going to demand.  that is going to be our answer.    the international community is uneasy because of what is happening in el salvador.  cristiani is no tame dove.  he has become an accomplice and instrument of this policy of death implemented by the army, by men like (colonel rene emilio) ponce and (general juan rafael) bustillo.  they are murderous guardsmen just like those you knew, the somozist guardsmen.  bustillo, ponce, and a few others are just like that.  however, not all of them are like that. there are some honest soldiers in el salvador, soldiers with honest positions.

(aylwin) first, chile maintains a firm stand on this subject, a fact that must be clearly understood by the chilean people and the rest of the world.  chile does not have any border conflicts with bolivia.  our border with bolivia has been ratified by an international treaty that was freely approved by our two countries. this treaty constitutes an obligatory norm for chile and bolivia.    second, according to this treaty, chile has always been willing to grant bolivia transportation facilities to ports on the pacific coast.    third, in face of the bolivian aspirations to obtain greater facilities or a new transit system, the first thing to be done is to reestablish diplomatic relations.  this is a bilateral issue between bolivia and chile.  it is not an hemispheric matter or a matter to be decided by international organizations.    i trust that bolivia and chile will reestablish diplomatic relations in an atmosphere of friendship and cooperation.  we must be aware that the world is heading toward integration and that it is more convenient for all of us to attain the best and most integrated relations possible.  we must seek solutions and, as the bolivian president recently stated, we must seek imaginative solutions with a 21st century and not a 19th century view.  i hope that within this spirit we will manage not only to reestablish relations with bolivia, but to establish satisfactory relations for the two countries.    (sola) chilean relations with the united states have not been excellent over the past few years, and the murder of orlando letelier is tied into this situation.  what is your opinion on this subject, considering that a u.s. court has requested the extradition of general contreras and colonel espinoza?    (aylwin) well, i hope that chile will maintain the best relations possible with all the countries of the world, including the united states, a country with which we are linked for many reasons.  i discussed this subject with people from u.s. diplomatic, political, and economic circles, and i have noted their willingness to improve relations and solve the problems that are currently separating us as soon as a democratic government is reestablished.    i do not think that an extradition will solve the letelier case because it has already been ruled on by the supreme court.  it is what we lawyers refer to as an adjudged matter.  i think that chile can demonstrate its willingness to help clarify the case and guarantee justice, as it is our (word indistinct) purpose in all human rights problems, so as to satisfy the most demanding consciences of the world.

(ponce) the cynicism of the dictator ortega of the sandinist government has been fully proven.  in the previous meetings within the framework of esquipulas ii, he committed himself to discontinuing support for the fmln.  this total war offensive that has been inflicted upon the salvadoran people should be suspended, because we are sure that the moment nicaragua and cuba -- it is through those countries, rather those governments that the communist bloc has been helping the fmln -- the fmln would weaken tremendously.  (sentence as heard)    as a member of the armed forces, as a member of the high command, i feel very proud about the professional, determined, and courageous attitude with which the officers, non-commissioned officers, and troops of our armed forces have neutralized and defeated the fmln offensive.  in this regard, i believe that the opinions voiced by general thurman are not really in line with what we have lived here inside the country.

(cristiani) \"as you all have been able to see for yourselves, the government has never been against continuing the dialogue process to find a political solution to the salvadoran conflict.  it has been the fmln that unilaterally broke this dialogue process by not turning up at caracas, venezula, as had been agreed in san jose, costa rica.  we, however, are going to make a definite proposal in costa rica, which in general terms is as follows:    \"the salvadoran government is willing to restart the dialogue process.  most convenient would be for this to take place in caracas, with the following condition: begining 15 december, 3 days after the central american presidential meeting (3-second break in reception), the fmln should publicly declare and give proof of compliance that it will end all types of terrorist acts, especially those that directly or indirectly affect civilians.  we want to clarify that we are not asking them to lay down their arms, as was attempted many times.  if the fmln continues its irrational behavior, the armed forces will continue fighting them.  terrorist actions against civilians must end. the people do not deserve to continue being the most affected by the irrationality of all this fighting. we think the least the fmln can do is to stop all actions that affect, directly or indirectly, the civilian population.  military targets are something else; but if we analyze things, up to this moment not a single military objective was the target since 11 november.  they have not even been able to take over a civil defense post.  all actions have been against civilians, trying to intimidate them, trying to create terror among the population.  the cessation of terrorist acts should be the fmln's proof of sincerity and will to really try and seek a solution by way of dialogue.  if the fmln today accepts ending all actions against the civilian population, then we are willing on 20 december to go to caracas and to continue the dialogue process and talks on all the topics the fmln wishes to talk about. thjis will be in order to ensure that by 15 february we have a solution to the conflict.\"  (continued)",

(montenegro) the truth is that the reasons why the fmln began its offensive on 11 november 1989 have not changed at all.  thus, the fmln cannot stop its offensive.  on the contrary, what happened in el salvador is that the fmln offensive strategically turned the war. that turn included a number of military, political, and diplomatic implications.    thus, the truth is that the agreement signed in san isidro de coronado did not propose realistic negotiations for the conflict. yesterday, 12 december, the fmln issued a communique which vehemently expressed its absolute rejection of the agreement signed at the presidential summit.  at present, the fmln believes that despite what the other four central american presidents say, it is clearer than ever that the salvadoran government is a fascist, military dictatorship.  the salvadoran government violates people's human rights and that fact has been clearly proved to the entire international community.  therefore, any attempt to help the salvadoran government or any kind of support given to it nothing but a piece of paper that does not have too much validity to the fmln.

(montenegro) i believe the fmln's armed struggle is now more legitimate than ever.  the summit confirmed the legitimacy of the fmln's struggle, because the agreement resulting from that summit is neither feasible nor real.  the fmln will therefore continue its political - military offensive.  the fmln will increase its actions. the fmln is reorganizing (readecuar) its political - military apparatus.  in the next few days, we will clearly show what the fmln can do.  the fmln will not surrender its weapons, especially now.  the fmln has no obligation to abide by an agreement that does not reflect the salvadoran reality at all.    if the central american presidents chose to close their eyes to what is going on that is really their problem.    (bernard) two days after the end of the central american summit, what is the current military situation in el salvador?    (montenegro) as i told you earlier in answering the first question, the first thing is that the fmln definately changed the war.  this means that the fmln made the salvadoran armed forces retreat from the mountains to the heart of the cities including the capital city of san salvador.    at present, we have almost absolute control over the highways in 14, i mean 12 salvadoran departments.  there have been actions in ahuachapan and sonsonate, two departments that had been almost untouched by the war.    there is a strategic siege in san salvador.  the army has 65 percent of its forces stationed in san salvador.  the army has abandoned large areas.    as for sabotage operations, at present there are 10 110,000-volt primary lines that are out of service.  that represents a 40-percent energy deficit in the country.  there have been long periods of 100-percent power outages in san salvador.  it is very unlikely that the government can control that situation.  we do not know how long they will endure it.  but in any case, a strong blow by the fmln forces is expected to occur somewhere in el salvador at any time.

            "doc": "after an exhaustive investigation, the salvadoran archbishopric legal assistance office issues the following statement regarding the massacre of the six jesuit priests:    the operation carried out to murder the six jesuit priests and the two maids lasted longer than 1 hour.  during all that time, the perpetrarors fired their weapons and detonated explosives.  this was proved by the finding of many shell casings near the jesuits' residence.  the witness' statements also confirmed that the weapons were fired over a long period of time.  the number of individuals who committed the crime was large.  they were wearing army uniforms.  the witness saw approximately five individuals wearing army uniforms. the witness saw the men.  she also heard the shooting, the closing of doors, and the breaking of glass in various parts of the facilities. the witness said that five individuals entered the servants' entrance of the jesuits' residence.  other individuals entered the residence by the door located in the northwestern end of the building, which is the area where the priests have their rooms.  another group entered the jesuit center, searched it, and burned it with sophisticated weapons such as flamethrowers.    3.  (no numbers 1 and 2 as heard) the salvadoran military intelligence, the perpetrators, knew the jesuit center and the jesuit residence.  in other words, they knew the uca (central american university) facilities.  on monday, 13 november, individuals wearing army uniforms specifically searched the jesuit center and residence.    4.  the scene of the crime is located inside an army control and security area since the armed forces joint chiefs of staff is located in that same general area.  the army maintains permanent military surveillance posts at the democracia building, the manuel jose arce military neighborhood, the northern uca entrance, at the various uca schools, and at la ceiba de guadalupe and jardines de guadalupe neighborhoods.  all those areas are well guarded by soldiers.    5.  despite the evident and verifiable militarization of the area where the crime took place, the curfew, the extended and heavy firing inside the uca premises, the detonation of explosives for an extended period of time during which the perpetrators remained inside the jesuit facilities -- which gave the perpetrators time to search the jesuit priests' rooms, kill them along with the other two victims, and search and burn the jesuit center church, thus proving the size of the operation -- the armed forces did not react as they would have if this operation had been carried out by the fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front).  this indicates that the soldiers in charge of security in the manuel jose arce military neighborhood and the armed forces joint chiefs of staff installations were aware of the operation that was being carried  out.    therefore, the archbishopric's legal assistance office concludes that all the evidence indicates that military personnel of the salvadoran armed forces are responsible for the murder of the six jesuit priests and the two maids.",

(begin recording) (hernandez) i made personal statements as a witness. i told them what i saw and heard at the site of the crime. that is what i did.  the prosecutors asked me about the evidence i had gathered at the site of the crime.  i picked up four bullet casings. the prosecutors said i had committed a crime.  that is, therefore, the crime i committed.

(reporter) yes, but what proof does the church have to make that assertion?

(cabral) today, 11 december, after 1 month of a glorious and victorious offensive, we have some thoughts regarding this latest fight.  we want to stress that all our offensives have centered around the main cities in our country.  one of the most important and significant achievements of this struggle by the people and the fmln is having maintained the besiegement on the most important political and economic points, most especially on the country's capital.  there has been great pressure in the case of san salvador, and the fmln has forced the joint chiefs of staff, colonel ponce, and the fascist high command to change their strategic tactics three times.    you will recall that the joint chiefs of staff first tried to dislodge the fmln forces that had entered since the evening of 11 november.  when the first puppet army strategic defense tactic failed, they then tried to isolate the fmln forces from one another and annihilate them one by one.  for this, they concentrated special forces, especially using elite battalions, in a siege modality for annihilation.  this also failed.  faced with the second failure of their special tactics to end the offensive in a few days, as cristiani and the high military command had said, they moved a great number of operational forces from the country's interior, such as the elite battalions, to set up an extensive siege to defend the capital city and prevent our forces from entering it.  as all our people have been able to see -- and international public opinion has also been able to verify this through a great amount of information flowing through international reporters -- that siege to keep out the fmln has also failed.  this means more victories and successes, such as incursions into the escalon neighborhood and the southern area of antiguo cuscatlan, and two important attacks on the joint chiefs of staff.    right now we see that the puppet army's special city operation is their third and last plan.  they have formed four commands to control the city, which will also be defeated by our fmln military forces.  we also must add to this list of achievements that the great concentration of enemy army operational forces in the capital has caused a great national imbalance in forces.  this means that extensive areas of the country are without the protection of the puppet troops.  we have taken advantage of this and have worked on organizing the people and raising a people's power, an alternative to local reactionary power.    we also record as a successful offensive during this first month the fact that our enemy's intelligence work has been completely smashed.  the searches, which have been entrusted in an improvised manner to military troops concentrated in the cities, especially the repressive corps, have attempted to restore all the intelligence data banks to be able to try and destroy the people's struggle.  we must also record as one of the successes of our general offensive during this first month the fact that the puppet army was forced to abort another plan.  even though there were some bloody events, such as the murder of the jesuit priests, along with a great amount of kidnappings and missing people and arrests of members or leaders of grassroot people's movements, we feel that the army and repressive corps are incapable of attending to the fmln offensive and the besiegement at the same time that they are trying to carry out their annihilation of the people's movement.  so this is another success.

            "doc": "a few months ago, it was speculated that changes of command in certain armed forces key posts would take place late in 1989.    colonel rene emilio ponce, joint chief of staff, disregarded this possibility and said that the situation of violence in the country, particularly since the fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front) offensive, requires, more than ever, that the armed forces are militarily stable.    (begin recording) (ponce) i think the situation in the country demands military stability.  changes could provoke some unrest.  we think no significant changes in the military command should be made at present because of the current situation.  should any changes be made, it would be for major reasons in the service. no high-level changes have been anticipated, however. (end recording)    referring to the rebels' activities, col ponce said the armed actions initiated, particularly in san salvador on 11 november, have ended with unfavorable results for the guerrillas.  he advised, however, that the guerrillas will continue to sabotage the country's economy and perpetrate terrorist actions.    (begin recording) (ponce) i can tell you that the fmln has failed, militarily speaking.  the fmln's famous all - the - way offensive has ended in tremendous failure, determined by the salvadoran people.  we can anticipate that the fmln will continue its sabotaging actions and terrorism which could destroy stores in san salvador, as well as posts and pylons on highways. the salvadoran people can rest assured, however, that an offensive action by the fmln at present can be disregarded. (end recording)    regarding the christmas and new year festivities, which have been marred by the wave of violence, many people have wondered whether the 2300 - to - 0500 curfew is still in force.  ponce said the possibility of lifting the curfew at least on 24 and 31 december is being considered so that the salvadoran families can enjoy these festivities.  he added that such a measure, however, will depend on the fmln's stance.  finally, ponce reported that the fmln machinegunned a building with coffee harvesters in santa ana and maimed two people simply because they refused to stop harvesting coffee.",

(society of jesus), the jesuit provincial spokesman for central america, has released a note denying inexact reports on the case of the murdered jesuit priests.  he said that they not were marxist guerrilla sympathizers.    the note reads as follows:    23 december 1989    prov. 264/89    director dutriz    director of la prensa grafica    san salvador    dear mr.director:    the newspaper which you direct, on 21 december 1989, published on pages 6 and 7 two articles on the six jesuit priests that were murdered on 16 november.  these articles are written in such a way that they distort the reality of the case or they incorrectly describe the activity of the society of jesus.    on page 6 an article entitled \"fratricidal struggle,\" which is signed by mr. luis pazos, says that \"the priests were marxist guerrilla sympathizers\" and that the university in which they work \"is known in el salvador as an intellectual center for guerrillas.\"    the article speaks of \"these priests' neomarxist-philosophical position which is contrary to christian doctrine.\"    i wish to state that:    1. the murdered priests were not sympathizers of the marxist guerrillas.  they only tried to talk with the different sectors in conflict in el salvador, seeking to mediate in an effort to find peace with justice.    2. perhaps some people in el salvador consider the uca (central american university) as an intellectual center for guerrillas, but there are also many people who think that the uca courageously follows the church's social doctrine.  this statement, if made without the reservation that it only represents the views of a group of people and the fact that the article forgets to mention the many others do not believe, is in our opinion a manipulation of the truth.    3. the position of the priests was not \"neomarxist\" in the philosophical field.  father ellacuria came from the school of the spanish philosopher zubiri, whose thoughts were deeply rooted in christian philosophy.  father amando lopez wrote his doctoral thesis on the spanish philosopher and priest amor ruibal.  the \"zubirian\" inclination of father ellacuria was internationally known in most philosophical schools.  those who accuse the murdered priests of having neomarxist philosophical positions are publicly acknowledging their ignorance.    4. statements such as these, which were repeated in other media before the murder of the priests, partly promoted their murder.  we therefore consider their repetition to be a very serious matter.    on page 7, and in an editorial article, the newspaper mentions the need to avoid \"the damage caused by private pseudo-investigations, wherever they might come from.\"  on this statement i want to simply add that in a case like this the injured party has every right, both in el salvador and in any other part of the world, to conduct its own private investigation.  furthermore, unless publicly and irrefutably proven harmful, no one has the right to condemn it \"in advance\" saying that it is playing detectives.    i beg of you mr. director, based on the right to reply and the justice that the murdered jesuits and those who believe in them deserve, that you publish this clarifications in your newspaper with the same desire to reach your readers as those who wrote the articles.    yours truly.    father jose maria tojeira    society of jesus provincial.\"",

(begin recording) (alfredo villarreal, correspondent) col vargas believes the u.s. aid is not only a matter of military assistance provided to the salvadoran army, but also a matter of defending the democratic process in the country.  the military officer said it is not possible that a minority, as he termed the fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front) will affect, with its disinformation methods aimed at countries abroad, u.s. military aid being cut off or decreased.  however, in any case, col vargas said that if the aid is suspended, this would complicate the armed forces plans concerning the counterinsurgency struggle.    (col vargas) i certainly do not believe that we, having a democratic society, have so little capacity to defend the truth.  it can take 100 days to spread a lie, but you can tell the truth in 1 day.  i do not believe that in this context....(changes thought) i believe we are overestimating the left-wing actions.  we view them as being smart, and we see ourselves as fools.  any cut or suspension in the aid will cause problems because it will create further needs whenever we need to fulfill a mission.  therefore, missions will be a bit more complicated, but we will fulfill them.  if marxists -- through their concept of disinformation -- believe they can attempt to harm the united states-el salvador alliance through this process, and that this will lead them to power, they are completely wrong.  they will find an armed forces which will always be firmly determined to defend the democratic process.    (correspondent villarreal) col vargas, in charge of the 3d military zone in san miguel, said he agrees with the decision to prosecute the eight military men, including one colonel and two lieutenants, charged with killing six jesuit priests.  col vargas said those who have broken the law must pay for it, no matter who they are.    (col vargas) the army will feel pain in the event any of its members are involved in actions which violate the principles that rule the armed forces.  this is very painful.  however, if we are building a democracy, there are facts that must be judged according to the norms prevailing in a democracy.  democracy must prevail over people. democracy is more important than individuals and than institutions in individual terms, and more important than the individual interest of people or groups, which cannot prevail over the national interest.    (correspondent villarreal) in the military aspect, col vargas said that as of 1990, in his area of responsibility, they are implementing the plans drafted by the joint chiefs of staff known as \"victory and hammer\" which has offered, as preliminary results, 53 clashes, 37 guerrillas and 12 soldiers killed, and weapons seizures.  the two operations, he added, have been successful.

(lemos) did you say for the past 4 years?    (reporter) that is what jaramillo ossa said, that the government was responsible for his safety during the past 4 years.  he also said that whatever happened from then on would also be blamed on your statement, and that the best service you could give the country would be to resign.    (lemos) i already replied to a question about my resignation.  i cannot resign because i am not guilty.  by resigning i would be admitting my guilt to something i had nothing to do with.  however, i am glad that you mentioned that this has been occurring for the past 4 years.  i was a journalist four years ago.    (reporter) (words indistinct) made a mistake a few days ago by again linking the up with the farc?    (lemos) i prefer not to discuss this topic now.  i do not think that this is the best time to discuss that subject.    after this situation has settled, i will have to file a formal statement at the attorney general's office where i have been summoned by the up.  as a government official, i am obliged to appear before the attorney general's office to explain my actions, but now is not the moment to explain anything.    (reporter) (question indistinct)    (lemos) of course, the president is very distressed, as we all are. we believe this is a terrible; there is no justification for something like this to happen.  it is evident that people who are seeking a goal opposite to that of the government are involved in this.  the government wants a free electoral process; it is committed to that.    today, when we have a completely orderly electoral process, it would be absurd, illogical, irrational, and senseless for the government to promote actions that run counter to its goal of ensuring that its term ends in peace and that the elections will take place normally.    (reporter) the up has again cast doubt over the government's guarantees for the candidates and the party.    (lemos) i believe that the government has done everything humanly possible to guarantee the safety of candidates, not only the safety of up members, but of all presidential candidates, regardless of their affiliation.    (words indistinct) in their communique, evidence of the fact that dr jaramillo's bodyguards reacted and, i understand, by killing one of the assassins, at least that is what i have heard, and arrested another one, which has been confirmed, shows that the government is indeed offering protection.    therefore, dr. jaramillo was indeed enjoying government protection just as the other presidential candidates are.  what happens is that the assassins carry out surprise attacks.  at a given moment, an approaching person can can pull out a weapon and kill whomever he wants.  there is no 100-percent prevention against this.  this holds true not only in colombia but in many countries in the world.  the very course of these terrible events of this morning at the aiport show that dr jaramillo was indeed protected.    (reporter) the up has just announced that it will file suit against you for this assassination.    (lemos) that is fine.  if the up has any evidence that i am involved in dr. jaramillo's assassination, then it must file suit, because otherwise, it would be acting as an accomplice to this assassination.  i believe that suits must be filed by those who suspect that a government official, and myself particularly, may be involved in the assassination, to ensure that the incident is investigated.  therefore, i believe that this is good news amid a sea of bad news that we have heard today.    (reporter) (words indistinct) only responsibility for physical safety, but there is also political responsibility.  you are being accused of political irresponsibility and of not responsibile for physical safety.

            "doc": "the reformist sector of the leftist patriotic union (up) today resigned from the party's national coordinating board, creating an unprecedented crisis in its five years of political life.    during the second day of its plenum, twelve of its 20 members, including up president diego montana cuellar, resigned from the national coordinating board, which also includes activists of the communist party of colombia (pcc).    according to sources close to the up, the reformist faction resigned from the coordinating board because it believes that what is needed in colombia is a broad social democratic movement, such as that advocated by up presidential candidate bernardo jaramillo ossa, who was assassinated on 22 march.    the leftist sources consulted by efe indicated today that the possibility of participating in the 27 may presidential elections, at least with a joint up and pcc candidate, is growing more distant.    while the up's reformist faction rejects the armed path as a means to achieve power, the sector known as the radicals, in other words, the eight members who did not resign from the coordinating board, agree on using different forms of struggle, including guerrilla struggle.    the eight members who did not resign belong to the pcc.    in addition to montana, leaders angelino garzon, guillermo banguero, alberto rojas puyo, julio santana, and luis emiro valencia were among those who resigned.    at the same time, 12 members of the national committee, another section of the party, also resigned.  they are also from the reformist faction.    the friction with the reformists or perestroyka supporters began on 28 march, the first day of sessions of the plenum, when angelino garzon charged that the pcc had intercepted jaramillo ossa's letters.    another reason for the division within the colombian left was the not very favorable results in the 11 march legislative and municipal elections, when the up and the pcc lost several seats in the colombian congress.    up to 22 march, the day when jaramillo was assassinated, he was the single presidential candidate of the up and the pcc, but after his death, both parties agreed to hold a plenum to decide whether they will participate in the elections.",

(reporter) has any thought been given to suspending the elections after this assassination, bearing in mind that pizarro was one of the most important candidates?    (seprpa) he was undoubtedly one of the most important candidates. the government always thought so.  in addition, the government highly regards the peacemking process it has been carrying out with the m-19, in which pizarro was undoubtedly a key player.  we have adopted some decisions in this regard.  i am going to meet with the head of state and all of us will be closely watching the sad developments which colombia is experiencing with a desire to meet the need for tranquillity and coexistence which, unfortunately, we have not had thus far.    (reporter) mr. minister, what does the fact that two presidential candidates have been assassinated in less than 40 days represent to the government?  how does the government look before the nation and the world?    (serpa) well, i repeat, this is a very sad circumstance.  this is extremely worrisome, of course.  like all colombians, we are troubled over the fact that we are constantly being flooded with crime and bloodshed.  the government is doing the impossible to protect all citizens and to guarantee the elections and the normal development of colombians' lives.  however, there are deluded minds and there are criminals who are interested in damaging the country.  this is an attack against colombia, against the colombian people.    (reporter) mr. minister, have you at any time thought of adopting special measures?  what is the status of the public order situation in colombia at this time?  what reports do you have?

(gonzalez) mr. president, i want to make a question that was made in spanish before and it's related about colonel ochoa perez.  he has been a hard-line military and don't you think that his (words indistinct) got to be possible?  this is one and i got a second one.  can you tell us in english what's going to be the relation with the new nicaraguan government and what do you know about recent machinegun traffic of the guerrillas?    (cristiani) well, with the first case my opinion is that anybody that has any information with respect to the assassination of the jesuit priests should -- instead of speculate with it publicly -- should go straight to the court that is in charge of the case and give all the information available to him or that he is knowledgeable of, and then have the judge do something about it.    i think that mere speculation in public is something that is not good for the judicial process because it creates problems for it. secondly, even though he was a high-ranking officer, in cases like this, it is not necessarily the opinion of a specific member of the armed forces is one which is totally true or totally false (sentence as heard).  you cannot simply go by that as a way to simply state that his statements are true.    it is very interesting to see that whereas before no one really would believe col. ochoa, all of a sudden everyone wants to give him all the credibility in this case.  i am not saying that what he said is true or untrue.  my point is that it should not be debated publicly; that anybody -- col. ochoa, members of the jesuit community, or anybody else -- who has any information with respect to the trial should go to the judge and give him that information because that would be helping the process and not mere speculations in public.    with respect to the relations with nicaragua, we discussed this with one of the advisers of mrs. chamorro during our visit and we decided to initiate (32-second break in transmission) plans and, therefore, we are willing to reinitiate the process.  her adviser was very clear to state that they will by no means aid the fmln in that respect.    we think that what has been happening between the 25th of february and the 25th of april is that the fmln thought that it was time to get all that was left in nicaragua....(corrects himself) out of nicaragua because they knew of the problems they would face with the new government, and that they could no longer go about freely in nicaragua with their weapons and their logistic support.  therefore, they have been trying to bring them in.  in that case there was a group of fmln members who were detained in honduras with the help of the honduran authorities, and it was obvious that they had been shipping weapons by land through honduran territory, but that group was detained.

            "doc": "a group purportedly representing young salvadoran military officers has called for a purge of the armed forces here, accusing their superiors of involvement in the massacre of six jesuit priests.    the call came wednesday in the wake of a bold offensive by leftist guerrillas who attacked strategic targets across the capital, including the residence of president alfredo cristiani, in a show of force before peace talks.    the statement distributed to news organizations was made in the name of a \"commando of young officers.\"  it gave no names but said the group was formed secretly among officers fed up with corruption by a small group of military leaders.    if authentic, the statement would mark the first time since a 1979 military coup that a group of junior officers had broken ranks with el salvador's military leadership.    \"today more than ever, all the officers who truly want to save our institution, must demand and exact profound changes and a general purge at all levels of the armed forces,\" the statement said.    the statement blamed a threatened loss of u.s. military aid on a few corrupt officers whom it held responsible for the \"execrable\" assassinations of six roman catholic priests during a rebel offensive in november.    el salvador is supposed to receive 315.4 million dollars in u.s. aid this year, 85 million dollars of it in military aid.  but the u.s. house of representatives has voted to cut military aid in half and u.s. secretary of state james baker has warned that aid to el salvador will depend on progress in the priests' case.    the priests, their housekeeper and her daughter were murdered in their residence november 16 in the midst of prolonged and bloody guerrilla offensive in the city.  nine members of the salvadoran armed forces have been charged in the killings but mr. cristiani has expressed doubts that they will be convicted.    \"it is truly sad and infuriating for us that the loss of prestige of the armed forces has grown so much that internationally we are seen as the ones to blame for the situation our country is in,\" said the statement attributed to the young officers.    the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln), meanwhile, also said its attacks in san salvador early wednesday were to protest the lack of progress in prosecuting members of the military for the massacre of the priests.    but analysts said the renewed fighting appeared intended as a show of force ahead of u.n.-mediated peace (word indistinct) this month, which seek to end a decade-long civil war that has left more than 70,000 dead.    in the fighting early wednesday, at least seven government troops were killed and 18 were wounded, an army spokesman said.  there were no casualties in the attack on the presidential residence and mr. cristiani was not at home at the time, the spokesman said.    the rebels retreated to their stronghold around the san salvador volcano just north of the capital after the attacks in upper class neighborhoods.    the united states sharply condemned the attacks and called on the rebels to demonstrate they can work with the government of el salvador to end the war.    \"we condemn the outrageous violence by the fmln,\" said state department spokesman richard boucher.  \"the fmln has demonstrated that it can destroy the salvadoran economy and kill salvadoran citizens.\"",

(cabrera) mr. president, if the communique issued by the young military officers is true, if it is true that they are members of the armed forces, what is the outlook for the armed forces and for your government?    (cristiani) i believe some speculation would be required.  i believe that as an anonymous letter, it cannot be given the credit it deserves, if it was written by someone who is completely responsible. in this regard, i repeat that the armed forces have been willing to conduct a process of professionalizing and modernizing.  they are trying to improve their institution as much as possible.    (moderator) luisa melgar from teleprensa.    (melgar) mr. president, yesterday the fmln carried out different armed actions in different parts of the country.  a communique issued by the fmln general command justified the actions because of alleged human rights violations, repression, and lack of security for civilians.  how do you view these actions just when the talks are about to begin?    (cristiani) i read the communique and i honestly believe that it is one of the most ridiculous fmln communiques i have seen to date.  it is a justification that is not very justifiable, i would say.  i believe the events on 1 may in the morning can clearly be understood. all groups wishing to participate were able to march peacefully. their freedoms are not being repressed. i imagine you have all heard and seen what they said and did and there were no problems.  i feel that this was a way to seek notoriety through the news.  this could be one of the reasons.  the other reason could be that they are having problems among themselves.  we have information telling us that there are differences among the different groups.  some of them view the dialogue as something serious, while others do not, and it could be that these problems are resulting in these irrational adventures by the fmln.  i feel that at this stage of the dialogue process, their actions are completely unjustifiable.  that is not all.  they have even violated what they have called unilateral gestures made in the past.  this shows the lack of seriousness and sincerity in all of them, or some of them, concerning the objectives we are trying to achieve with the dialogue process.    (cristiani) guillermo penate from el diario de hoy.    (penate) there are some labor groups that want to be included in the delegation that will participate in the talks with the fmln. could this not be some sort of disadvantage for the official delegation, because the opposite groups could gain strength?    (cristiani) i think that is true.  some groups have asked to be included in the delegation.  i believe the participation of the different groups is stipulated in the geneva agreements.  we have already explained how the government can allow for the participation of political and social sectors of the country.  we are not going to change the government commission, which is comprised of government officials for the most part.  i believe that the participation of members of social organizations has already been explained in the past.    (moderator) raul beltran from radio cadena yskl.    (beltran) mr. president, over the past few hours we have learned about the official statement issued by the commanders of the various garrisons and the high command.  since you are the commander in chief of the armed forces, do you support the document that was published, which condemned the statements made by col. sigifredo ochoa perez?    (cristiani) concerning that situation, i have said that several people have made statements, not just one.  there has been public speculation as to what may have happened in the assassinations of the jesuit priests and the other two people and that is not right.  if someone has any information to contribute, and if that someone is really interested in the progress of justice in this country, he should go to the judge to give him the information.  he should not continue to speculate in public, because it confuses people and it obstructs the judicial process.    i would like to mention, for example, that not long ago a delegation of spanish legal experts visited the country and they were pleased to see how the 4th criminal judge was handling the judicial process, as opposed to other reports that have been released in the united states.  however, i believe that no one should speculate in public as to what may have happened.  if someone has information or evidence, he should go to the judge, otherwise there will be confusion.  in that regard, i believe that the armed forces commanders' rejection of col. ochoa's statements is just that.  in many of the statements they wrote -- i did not participate in drafting the statement -- they mentioned that they are willing to support and strengthen the judicial process, but they cannot come out in public with speculation because they would only confuse people.

(begin recording) (larios) we all know what will happen regarding the military aid.  unfortunately, we must admit we cannot decide the terms under which we will receive that military aid.  they must do that.  they will decide when and by how much that aid will be cut.    (reporter) general, do you think that the 60 minutes program in which col.ochoa perez participated was influential in the decision to ask the the u.s. house of representatives to cut the aid?    (larios) i think that it has definitely been influential.  we must undoubtedly recognize this.  nevertheless, that is not all.  i believe that the situation existed even before the 60 minutes program was broadcast.  therefore, i believe that the problem existed regardless of what was said during the 60 minutes program, and we were (words indistinct).    (reporter) what were the issues which had already determined this? what could they be?    (larios) that is really nothing new.  the jesuits' case has been, let us say, the decisive factor for deciding one thing or another in the u.s. congress, senate, and administration about the military aid. that is basically the issue. (end recording)    gen. larios also talked about possible changes which might occur in the army leadership.  recent rumors indicate that he might leave his post as defense minister, and that changes might occur within the armed forces high command.  he said that he does not rule out the possibility that these changes may occur, but he termed them as routine.    referring to a u.s. television program which implied colonel orlando zepeda's participation in the jesuits' case, the defense minister said he does not believe this type of information because the deputy defense minister is a colleague who only handles administrative issues within the army.",

(begin recording) (gonzalez) my impression during my 2 days of captivity is that they attach great importance to a debate on the nation's oil policy.  they demand that this debate be carried out through a council meeting, which would include representatives from the government, labor unions -- particularly the (uso) and ecopetrol unions -- as well as several prominent figures whom they listed in the letter to the president. (end recording)    gonzalez added that he agrees with comptroller rodolfo gonzalez that the government should talk with the eln, a guerrilla group which in the past has been the most unwilling to join the peace process.    (begin recording) (gonzalez) if the dialogue results in a solution to colombia's public unrest, then we must not avoid the dialogue; we must hold it. (end recording)",

            "doc": "the country is experiencing one of the worst anticommunist and terrorist campaigns in a long time. this campaign is similar to the one unleashed between 1964 and 1970.  the situation is further aggravated because it is taking place under a dictatorship that will stop at nothing to achieve its objectives.    during his speech in coihaique, pinochet threatened to end the state of law.  this has been followed by other threats by (deputy opponents, and by equally threatening statements and systematic aggression against army members who criticize the dictatorial regime.    meanwhile el mercurio and the progovernment news media have orchestrated a campaign that is financed by buchi's electoral managers. this campaign uses editorials, attributed articles, and paid ads that are aimed at misinforming and manipulating public opinion.    the objective is to create a mood of aggression toward the left and toward the communist party, a mood that would justify any kind of provocation.    the worst example was a recent paid ad published by buchi's electoral managers on an alleged threat of communist strike squads that were going to gun down the progovernment candidate. it is well known that this statement, reportedly made by a young christian democratic party leader to la segunda on 31 october, was later flatly denied by the christian democratic leader himself.  despite this denial, buchi's campaign managers are still harping on the subject, trying to create an atmosphere of violence and unease.    the brutal murder of jecar neghme, unsolved like so many others, has been followed by other serious events including the kidnapping of the driver of volodia teitelboim, the secretary general of the communist party. this was a threat to comrade volodia teitelboim's safety and physical integrity. there has also been harassment of leaders and candidates of the communist party and other democratic parties, an increase in the number of arbitrary arrests of opponents in general, the establishment of a new joint command headed by the defense minister. the alleged objective of this command is to fight crime, but the people have rightly guessed that it is a cover for political repression similar to that conducted by a prior organization that bore the same name.    in this anticommunist and antidemocratic atmosphere, meetings have been held with officers and relatives of military men. during these meetings the audience is misinformed, threatened, and urged to oppose democratic changes.  they are also urged to hoard staples and to take special measures to provide for extreme contingencies.    there is yet another especially serious development about which we want to inform the people.  we have received information from various sources to the effect that the crowning point of this anticommunist campaign will be an attack on a high-ranking army officer who has been criticized for his involvement in human-rights violations.  the charges against this officer made by communist party candidates for senators, and the demonstrations held against him by the relatives of the victims, will be used to blame the communists for this attack.    we want to reiterate our absolute rejection of human rights violations and our demand for truth and justice. however, we also want to make it clear that we are struggling to have every crime and every violation investigated and the culprits tried.    the atmosphere of fear and psychological warfare is aimed at twisting the popular will of the chilean people and destabilizing in advance the next democratic administration.    we call upon the citizenry to be prepared to display unity and democratic organization so as to guarantee the normal development of the ongoing electoral process and to be on guard against any provocation aimed at creating a climate favorable to an interruption of the process.  we must deploy our forces if we are to ensure the victory of freedom and democracy in a landslide victory for patricio aylwin on 14 december and the election of a congress capable of guaranteeing progress toward the government system that most chileans want.    signed: chilean communist party    dated: santiago, 2 november 1989",

(listener) sonora listeners, this is a last minute report.  just a few minutes ago, at 1130, two bombs exploded here at the eastern end of the central market.  five persons were seriously wounded in this terrorist attack.  they were just taken to the rosales hospital.  the wounded include a child and a woman.  we did not get their names because the authorities did not let us do so.  red cross personnel took the wounded to rosales hospital.    the people around here are very frightened and are running around.  the people were buying food when the explosions occurred.  they are nervous and are trying to quickly find transportation.  the explosions were heard far from here.  at the market's eastern gate, where the fruit stands are located, we were told by passersby that a man working there was the most seriously wounded by the bombs.  all the wounded were taken to the hospital.    the terrorists left a communique that was immediately picked up by the national police.    the people are fleeing the market.  they cannot continue shopping because it is assumed this was a warning to keep the people from going out or going to vote.",

(cristiani) at approximately 0530 this morning, three explosives were hurled at his residence from an empty lot.  the explosives caused extensive damage to the residence.  there was rifle fire too, but the rifle fire was only to distract security personnel in the area.    the attackers acted like animals.  mr merino is still in the united states with his wife.  he will be returning this afternoon.  their four children and three of the children's friends were at the residence when the attack took place.  the children could have been killed.  those who carried out this attack are people who for a long time have been talking about human rights and about indiscriminate bombings.  this attack endangered civilians.  thank goodness only one of the children was wounded.  one of the girls who was visiting the home was hit by some shrapnel but the wound is not serious.  right now we are getting a doctor to examine the children to see if their hearing has been damaged because two of the devices exploded in the bedroom the children were in.    i believe this is another indication that the fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front), far from seeking peace and wanting peace for the salvadoran people, wants to continue its terrorism, its killings -- its irrational killings.  i believe that little can be achieved in the search for peace through dialogue because these people are not sincere when they claim that they want to resolve the problem.    the salvadoran people are tired of violence.  they stated their opinion on 19 march.  the fmln should think carefully because the people have flatly rejected violence and the fmln.  i do not believe that the members of our party will be frightened into abandoning the struggle for the consolidation of democracy, which is something the people want.    i believe that those who want to make the fmln look like martyrs and like persons who work for the good of the people, should know the truth:  they are nothing but savages who lack human qualities and who are indiscriminately killing and wounding civilians who have nothing to do with the conflict.

(sentence as published) alvarado was killed by a bomb presumably placed by an urban guerrilla group on top of his armored vehicle as it stopped at an intersection in san miguelito neighborhood, north of the capital.    the fmln is abandoning \"guerrilla warfare tactics in rural areas and increasingly resorting to the establishment of civilian fronts in the main cities and to urban terrorism in an attempt to destabilize (the government).  at the international level, the guerrillas are trying to elicit negative reaction toward the new government to isolate us politically from the world,\" cristiani said.  vice president-elect francisco merino accompanied him.    he added: \"obviously, if warranted by the situation, we must resort to legal mechanisms.  should the situation become difficult or impossible to control, our harsher measure would be to declare a state of siege.\"    since early april, the fmln has been carrying out a strong offensive against private companies and the banking system and has stepped up sabotage actions against telephone and electricity networks.    in addition to the attack on the attorney general, there were other attacks, in which guerrilla deserter miguel castellanos and francisco pecorrini, both of whom were right-wing ideologues, were killed and carlos mendoza, chief editor of analisis magazine, was wounded.  castellanos and pecorrini were connected with that magazine.",

(end recording)    d'aubuisson said that if the fmln does not agree to the demobilization, the fmln members will be solely responsible if peace is not achieved. regarding the commission, he said it is already being organized and will begin a dialogue soon.

(begin recording) (montano) the national dialogue committee's proposal is a good one and the armed forces applauds it, and is in a position to accept it, as long as the fmln also complies with it. (end recording)    speaking at a news conference, col montano said that the maimed fmln fighters' presence at the metropolitan cathedral is an indication that fmln leaders abandon their fighters when they cease to be useful.

(end recording)    referring to the homily delivered yesterday by monsignor gregorio rosa chavez, auxiliary bishop of san salvador, who accused the air force of bombing the santa elena church in usulutan department, col montano said that some leftist clergymen distort the facts for propaganda purposes.

            "doc": "colombian defense ministry spokesmen reported today that army troops dealt a harsh blow to the medellin drug cartel over the past few hours.  the army troops seized five farms owned by gonzalo rodriguez gacha, the second most important medellin drug cartel chief.    according to official reports, the troops arrived at a rural area in central boyaca port municipality and raided five farms which, according to preliminary evidence, were used by the mafia to train rightist paramilitary groups.    according to secret police investigations, the paramilitary squads were formed by the medellin cartel to protect its interests.  the members of those squads were trained by israeli mercenaries headed by former lt col jair klein.    it was reported that since the beginning of the colombian offensive against the narco-criminal groups 3 weeks ago, joint army and police troops have seized 15 farms and several urban houses owned by gonzalez gacha.    freddy rodriguez celades, 17, son of rodriguez gacha, is still under arrest, after having been captured by the authorities along with other drug traffickers during an operation against one of the farms owned by the mafia leader.    meanwhile, it was learned today that fernando galeano berrio, suspected to be rodriguez gacha's finance chief, who was arrested a few days ago, was released by a criminal judge.    galeano berrio left his cell on thursday, 7 september, although he is one of the drug traffickers whose extradition has been requested by the united states and despite being charged with the murder of several leftist political leaders.    according to investigations, galeano was in charge of handling rodriguez gacha's finances.  thus, the possibility that galeano worked closely with eduardo martinez romero, medellin drug cartel finance chief, is not ruled out.  martinez romero was extradited to the united states on wednesday, 6 september.    reports published by the bogota morning newspaper el tiempo indicate that the authorities have confiscated 50 vehicles owned by drug baron rodriguez gacha.    according to the documents found at the medellin cartel accounting office, which operated in the middle of downtown bogota, rodriguez gacha could own approximately 400 vehicles, many of them armored vehicles or vehicles with powerful radio communications equipment.    similarly, the army seized a farm owned by pablo escobar gaviria in boyaca port municipality.  escobar is considered the world's biggest drug trafficker.    military spokesmen said that one of the many mafia schools for gunmen operated at that farm.  those gunmen are responsible for the massacres of peasants who worked in the northwestern banana region of uraba.    the operations against escobar gaviria continued yesterday when the group of mercenaries who served as escorts for escobar gaviria's  wife, maria victoria henao, was broken up.    according to reports, close aids of the capo were members of a criminal group called \"love for medellin.\"  this group is responsible for the murders of several prostitutes, homosexuals, and beggars.    it was also known that the members of the aforementioned group placed a car bomb across from the medellin telephone company, injuring five pedestrians and causing millions of pesos in property damage.    the dynamite attacks, which have become the mafia response to the government's heavy offensive, continued today when an explosive device went off at a private factory located in northwestern itagui municipality.",

(begin recording) (unidentified speaker) there were four men in a pickup, two seated in front and two in the back.  the two who were in the back took out the bazookas and fired on the garrison's gate.  a man driving a suzuki drove at the same time the rockets were launched and he was hit.    (reporter) how many people were in the vehicle?    (unidentified speaker) four.  the car where the injured man was? only one person, the man who was injured.    (reporter) how many people were in the vehicle from where the rockets where fired?    (unidentified speaker) four persons.    (reporter) at what time did that happen?    (unidentified speaker) about 30 minutes ago, at approximately 1530.    (reporter) how many rockets were fired?    (unidentified speaker) two.    (second unidentified speaker) the man was in the car.  after the devices exploded -- we do not know what kind were fired -- there was smoke and gunpowder all over the place.  his clothes and body were totally destroyed.  when we took him to the rosales hospital we talked to a doctor, and he said that they were going to do all they could to save his life.  (end recording)    meanwhile, colonel francisco elena fuentes, commander of the military garrison, regretted the attack and said that these attacks are within the framework of the violence unleashed in the past few days by groups that are out of control.    (begin recording) (fuentes) you have already seen the vehicle.  we believe the rockets were aimed at the gate, at the guards standing at the entrance of the headquarters.  perhaps they were aimed at me because i had been in the area 5 minutes earlier.    those people are completely out of their minds.  they do not care if the kill innocent civilians.  these could be groups that the fmln can no longer control or perhaps they are only killers who only know how to murder people.  (end recording)    the injured persons were taken to rosales hospital in san salvador where they were given emergency treatment.  the street vendor says that it was a miracle that she was not killed.    (begin recording) (perez) i do not know what happened.  i was just sitting there and i heard the noise (words indistinct).  (end recording)    meanwhile, the fmln urban guerrillas set fire to a public bush in santa marta, san jacinton neighborhood.  the rebels distributed leaflets stating that they burned the bus in reprisal for the killing of leftist leader fede elizabeth velasquez.",

(pinochet) i am unhappy with chileans because they have lost their feeling of nationality by accepting the presence of a bunch of outsiders who have come to look over what we are doing.  what do they think they are doing?  let me tell you something else: these outsiders are here to check on the way in which their money has been invested by the political parties and these gentlemen (a reference to opposition candidates in general).    (henriquez) as he was leaving the voting site, pinochet told a uruguayan correspondent that the observers are intruders.    interior minister carlos caceres affirmed that the situation around the country remains normal and orderly.  he added that the only incident was the bomb explosion at the el salvadoran embassy and a minor incident that took place this morning in the locality of maria pinto.  caceres said that he will remain all day at the la moneda palace in order to brief president pinochet on the voting proceedings and any security problem that might arise.    finally, he said that the head of state will also stay in his office.  this afternoon pinochet will probably visit the vote counting center of the interior ministry on monategui street.  good afternoon.

            "doc": "the annals of the colombian port of cartagena list three extremely fierce sieges.  back in 1586, the \"jewel of the caribbean\" was captured by sir francis drake, who did not burn the city to the ground only because he received a ransom of 10 million pesos.  a century later cartagena was occupied by the french.  finally, in 1741, the city's defenders successfully fought off an assault by a host of 27,000 pirates headed by sir edward vernon...    the western press described the meeting between the presidents of the united states, bolivia, colombia, and peru held a few days ago in cartagena as a kind of assault.  despite some exaggeration, this graphic description was based on perfectly serious grounds.  after all, the conference did discuss immediate tasks and even a detailed schedule for a joint offensive by the governments of these countries against criminal drug trafficking, which ranks first in the pecking order of crime.    it is indeed necessary to launch an assault against the drug mafia's strongholds, whether in medellin, \"famous\" for unbridled gangsterism, or in cartagena itself, whose status as a resort is threatened by the selfsame \"cocaine barons.\"  as a matter of fact, this tourist center has been repeatedly shaken in recent months by the explosions of bombs planted by terrorists in the \"hilton\" hotel, in stores, or at its marinas.  it is no wonder, as reuter reports, that not a single cruise ship has dropped anchor there this season.    yes, the situation is highly alarming, and this applies to the whole of colombia and even to the entire region.  in these conditions the firm resolve displayed by the participants in the cartagena meeting deserves understanding and support: the resolve to finally pool their efforts in the struggle against organized crime and to jointly place a reliable barrier in its path.  these are the intentions shown in the joint statement signed by the four presidents and by the series of special documents.    the aim of these agreements is noble indeed: to besiege the drug mafia in its nests, to cut off the \"laundering\" of drug dollars, and to deprive the merchants of \"slow death\" of broad access to the \"black market\" in the united states, where, as a matter of fact, the lion's share of south america's poisonous export is consumed.  in other words, an important step has been taken to combat one of the main \"evils of the 20th century,\" and it was not for nothing that the meeting's results were positively appraised by un secretary general j. perez de cuellar.    here is a different question: emphasis in cartagena was placed on administrative and police measures and on washington's primarily militarized forms of cooperation with the andean states, but does this conform with their long-term national interests, with their desire to put an end to backwardness and attain a qualitatively new level of socioeconomic development?  after all, a radical solution of the drug problem primarily demands neither combat aircraft not armored personnel carriers, but something quite different.  it is necessary to change the economic profile of vast provinces where the cultivation of coca and marijuana is the sole source of the population's existence.    true enough, the united states has now expressed readiness to assist also in this sphere.  on the other hand, there is an almost total lack of readiness to import from south america the crops which could, in principle, squeeze out coca and marijuana.  it was not for nothing that colombia's president virgilio barco, the white house's closest ally in the struggle against drugs, was forced to declare in cartagena that the u.s. government's rigid protectionist measures are jeopardizing the very future of \"alternative\" sectors of tropical crop farming -- the cultivation of coffee, flowers, and sugar cane.  and so the \"senior partner\" appears to be tightening with the one hand the vise in which the drug mafia now finds itself, while using the other hand to protect its market from legal latin american exports.    finally, the last but, i think, most substantive argument. actually, it also casts an unfavorable light on the role of consistent fighter against the drug mafia which washington has now assumed.  this argument is perfectly encapsulated in just one short word: \"panama.\" indeed, did the recent aggression against this sovereign state, one of whose main motives was actually \"to punish the drug business bosses,\" not demonstrate all the flaws of washington's \"strongarm approach\" toward latin america?  and are there any guarantees that the pentagon will not start \"copying\" its panamanian experience in other countries in the continent on the pretext of pursuing the \"cocaine barons\"?    these are far from rhetorical questions, and it is a pity that cartagena simply failed to provide even the slightest clear-cut answers to them.",

            "doc": "and, therefore, it does not seem like it is a total advancement in a democratic process, because obviously it is not very democratic to have the armed forces of a country under the control of one of its political parties.  the armed forces of a country should respond to the democratic process and to the government that is legitimately elected by the people.  and therefore, this would curtail the freedom of choice of the nicaraguan people in trying to control and govern the country, even though it is not from the position of being president of the country.  secondly, i think that i have mentioned before that it is not the result of the election that will change our attitude with respect to our diplomatic relations with nicaragua, but rather the attitude of the nicaraguan government with respect to aid to the fmln, to the marxist guerrillas in el salvador. and in this case we still have not seen that change taking place. obviously, we feel that with mrs chamorro as president of nicaragua that this aid will stop and therefore make it easier for the resumption of normal relations between el salvador and nicaragua, but it is that attitude that would make a change and not necessarily the result in itself.    with respect to the third question, obviously i think that if mrs chamorro really is in control, in total control, especially of the sandinista army, that there will be a stop in aid, and therefore the fmln would not have nicaragua's logistical and military support for them.  and therefore, this certainly affects them.    (reporter, in english) i think that about one week ago or two weeks ago in the washington post there was a report that colonel benavides was living a rather luxurious life.  i do not know if you have seen that piece.  and also the u.s. ambassador william walker has said that he felt that it was time that, well, the article implies that there was some pressure, or there was some protection coming from the tandona (reference to the 1966 graduating class of the captain general gerardo barrios military academy) to protect benavides, because he (words indistinct) their men and that some lower lieutenants were not going to be receiving any sort of protection and they may have to take the fault for what has happened.  and also william walker had said that he felt that it was time for some of the people in the tandona to step down and for other officers to move up.  what do you think about that (word indistinct)?  should there be that kind of pressure? should some of the guys in the tandona step down from their posts?    (cristiani, in english) well, i think that it is not really the determining factor whether you belong to a specific graduating class within the armed forces that should be what determines whether you continue or not, or be removed or not from the armed forces.  it is your own performance and your own behavior that should be the determining factor.    so, therefore, it is not necessarily that the tandona people, just for being members of the graduating class, (chuckles) that action should be taken against them.  so i think that in that case that is not really the point.    with respect to the other case, i think it is now in the hands of the judicial system in the country on how it goes, what type of defense those that have been arraigned have.  i think that they all are receiving the legal support in the case and the other (words indistinct).    (reporter, in english) as for the dialogue with the guerrillas, before you left for taiwan you conditioned the dialogue on a ceasing of acts of violence.  to be specific, does this mean (words indistinct) all acts of violence?  and also, when do you think that this dialogue can actually take place?    (cristiani, in english) well, if we could try and put into one basket and call that basket with a name with respect to the actions, we are asking the fmln to stop terrorist activities, because terrorist activity is affecting the civilian population.  you just mentioned the fact about a pole that they use for electrical distribution in the country.  just last night they blew up one and there are two people hurt.  two civilians that were passing by were hurt by that explosion. so that is what has to stop.  the fmln has to stop all terrorist activity, because that is the activity that hurts the civilian population.  that is not military activity.  that is something geared against or to confront the armed forces.  so it is that violence that can be summed up in what is called terrorism that we are asking for -- those activities that really affect the civilian population of the country.

            "doc": "the maoist shining path terrorist organization and the tupac amaru revolutionary movement (mrta) are staging attacks in an attempt to make the people boycott the 8 april peruvian elections.    a bomb exploded early this morning near the house of health minister paul caro gamarra.  caro's wife said that the house, which is in the port of el callao, lacks police protection.    the headquarters of the center-rightist democratic front (fredemo), whose presidential candidate is the writer mario vargas llosa, was bombed last night.  the mrta claimed the attack through leaflets left at the scene.    the mrta also planted explosives and left leaflets beside five fredemo placards.    forty members of fredemo were at the headquarters, which is on an important lima avenue, when the attack occurred.  nobody was injured. david cifuentes, a deputy candidate of the ruling american popular revolutionary alliance (apra) today said that there is a terrorist plot to kill the presidential candidates.    on 14 march cifuentes escaped unharmed from an attack on the car in which he was travelling.  his bodyguard died in the attack which occurred 40 km from the city of cajamarca.    the terrorists placed big stones at a curve in the road which caused the vehicle to run off the road.  the attackers then opened fire on the car.    cifuentes fell out of the vehicle and broke his arm in two places, and is now in hospital.    shining path members recently murdered 19 people, including 10 children, in a small village near huancayo city, 415 km south of lima. this act clearly shows that the maoists are determined to continue killing and destroying.    some 300 people were murdered by the shining path during the boycott of the municipal elections on 12 november 1989.    the attacks perpetrated by the mrta last night belies the alleged announcement that they will cease to use violence.  this announcement was published by a local newspaper two days ago.    united left deputy gustavo espinosa, in a statement to the daily onda, said that if the mrta is truly seeking a political way to turn in their weapons \"they would contribute to the pacification of the country.\"    however, espinosa said that one cannot consider an end to the violence until there is more proof of their announcement.    during the past 10 years, the shining path and the mrta have perpetrated more than 16,000 attacks which have caused damage estimated at $10,000.  this estimate was prepared by the congressional commission in charge of assessing the effects and causes of political violence in peru.    during president alan garcia's term of office the terrorists have perpetrated 10,621 attacks, which represents an average of more than six attacks per day during his five years in power.    fatal victims of political violence amount to approximately 19,000, of which 700 have died during 1990.",

(ponce) we, the armed forces, feel that these events are carried out by the terrorists within the fmln who do not believe dialogue is a mechanism for achieiving peace in our country.  these individuals believe that violence is what will lead them to power.

(ponce) taking into account the fact that current violent actions might come from groups outside the control of fmln leaders, we believe that the country's situation is not normal enough to say that there is no violence.  however, as a contribution to that propitious atmosphere for the dialogue, i believe that it is advisable to lift it.    (reporter) i have two questions: what is the armed forces' position regarding (words indistinct)?    (ponce) as for the first question, you are referring to statements by the president of the republic.  i believe that in due time he will have the opportunity to explain those statements.  i understand that the newsman distorted his words, but the president himself will have an opportunity to make the respective clarification.    i will, however, state that according to the reports that have been issued by the director general of the national police as to whether at any time colonel benavides has left the hands of the national police, he clearly said that at no time has benavides done this.  he is under the orders of the 4th penal judge, and at no time has the 4th penal judge authorized col. benavides to leave the confines of the jail.    the person who made the accusations should present some evidence, a photograph for example.  otherwise, this is all mere speculation. that is a very delicate case, and speculations cast a negative image on the armed forces and the country itself, and even on the administration of justice in our country.    concerning what could happen in the trial of the murder of the jesuits, the justice authorities will determine what will be done.  we will respect that decision.

            "doc": "the peruvian police, and parts of the army, have received orders of \"strict confinement to barracks\" in view of the 17 may anniversary of the terrorist organization shining path.  the organization has announced it will celebrate its 10th anniversary with an increase in armed operations.    peruvian authorities have discovered that the group that rebelled on 17 may 1980 has devised \"a celebrations plan\" and that it intends to implement the plan as \"a sign of victory\" in the \"struggle of movements,\" an ideology inspired in mao zedong's doctrine.    army personnel have been confined to barracks since the night of 12 may and have already participated on joint operations with the police to arrest 500 alleged terrorists.    in lima, 8,000 police agents and a special antiexplosives squad launched \"a gigantic operation\" of \"blockades and saturation.\"    a police spokesman told efe that they had orders \"to carefully comb the new urban areas and search for suspected criminals, arms, explosives, or subversive material.\"    according to the spokesman, the lima police department headed by general osvaldo diaz has orders \"to watch roads entering the city, to install emergency check points in strategic locations, and to report on anything unusual.\"    according to official sources, the operation will continue until after the runoff election, which is expected to be held on 10 june.    the police have launched similar operations in regions where guerrilla activity is rampant such as ayacucho, puno, huancayo, and huancavelica in the peruvian central highlands.  these regions are all under states of emergency and under military control.    shining path, considered one of the most impenetrable and orthodox armed movements in latin america, began celebrating its anniversary in lima last week by burning 11 state transport company buses. the buses were attacked by hooded individuals thought to be shining path militants.    on 11 may a bomb destroyed a building owned by the family of the mayor of lima.  in another incident in lima today, police corporal oswaldo palomino, who served in ayacucho until a short time ago, was shot to death.    in ayacucho, where the the comunist party of peru -- \"official\" name of shining path -- was born and developed, two people were murdered, and various home-made bombs exploded in in the last 24 hours.    councilmen juan manuel garabito from piura, 1,100 km north of lima, has also been shot to death. authorities blamed shining path for these attacks.    observers of the peruvian guerrilla movement told efe that the growing tide of violence attibuted to shining path indicates that the radical, or \"red\" sector, of the rebel group has taken control of the organization.    according to the sources, two different factions within the organization clashed over the celebration of the group's anniversary: the younger and radical sectors favored purely military operations while the older sector, or \"blacks,\" favored more political and historic activities.    shining path, which officially operates with approximately 5,000 armed men, has caused the death of 20,000 people, including 7,000 civilians, and it is responsible for $17 billion in direct damages to the country over its 10 year history.",
