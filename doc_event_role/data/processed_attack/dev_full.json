(passage omitted)    col quintero did not have a police escort.  just 8 days ago he decided to dismiss the escort, because he did not want anyone else to be killed if there were an attack on him.  only col quintero and a police driver were in the vehicle.    the judge of the 76th district court, who directed the removal of the body, said that several types of weapons were used in the attack and more than 100 shots were fired.

        "doc": "after nearly a 2-month absence from the national press, major roberto d'aubuisson holds the view that the armed forces should not be criticized for the isolated behavior of some of its members.  the arena (nationalist republican alliance) leader is of the opinion that the armed forces themselves were the ones that exerted pressure so that the jesuits' murder case could be cleared-up.    (begin recording) (d'aubuisson) it was not the institution (armed forces) that was involved in the problem.  regrettably some of its members did it and now the entire armed forces are under pressure for political reasons.  however, we must realize that it is thanks to the armed forces that we have this democratic process, with a hope that our country develops and recovers.  it is very unfair that some people pass judgment or criticize without really knowing how hard it has been on all the officers, noncommissioned officers, and troops who have had to put up with these attacks in addition to the intense work they have had for the past few months. (end recording)    d'aubuisson said that once the murder of the six jesuits has been cleared up, u.s. authorities have no reason to question the continuation of u.s. economic assistance to the country.    (begin recording) (d'aubuisson) the jesuits' case was a determining factor.  but now that the case has been fully solved with the help of the fbi, scotland yard, and investigators from other countries, this is no longer a problem, although previously it was serious.  i do not believe there can be any doubt now about receiving the aid, especially after the tremendous offensive launched by the fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front).  for argument's sake, if the situation did arise (whereby aid was suspended), this would only favor the fmln.  i know the fmln has a whole range of support groups that handle disinformation and make it appear as if things here were disastrous. for example, information abroad is that the air force leveled all the neighborhoods.  we salvadorans know that the air force was excessively cautious and did an excellent job repelling this attack with a minimum of civilians wounded.  for that matter, if we are going to compare things, u.s. military operations in panama were more clumsy -- there they set a whole neighborhood on fire. (end recording)    the arena leader also denied that there were differences between president cristiani and himself.  according to international press agencies, the decision of the salvadoran president to prosecute the military men involved in the jesuits' murder caused division within the party.  d'aubuisson denied this was true.    (begin recording) (d'aubuisson) not in the least.  there have never been any differences with president cristiani.  on the contrary, we are very close and grateful for the great effort, work, and the magnificent job president cristiani is doing.  this is reason for pride not only among friends of president cristiani but for the party and friends of the salvadoran government. (end recording)    in commenting on the dialogue with the fmln, d'aubuisson supported president critiani's initiative of engaging the assistance of the un secretary general.    (begin recording) (d'aubuisson) i do not think he has the time to act as mediator; however, he could act as a guarantor, receiving results of these talks and ensuring compliance with the commitments made. (end recording)    maj roberto d'aubuisson, currently an arena deputy, said that this year he will dedicate his time to expand and reorganize the party to get ready for the 1991 municipal and parliamentary elections.  he will most likely not be an arena deputy in the next legislative period, because he, along with other former legislators, will concentrate their political activities on the central american parliament.",

        "doc": "as a latin american president, i feel a little bit uncomfortable over the statement that the north americans are victims of the drugs produced in latin america and that colombia, peru, and bolivia are to blame for producing the drugs; let's call those countries to talk with them. that seems to me a very ethnocentric vision; it looks at this matter from only one side.  our peasants are poor people who produce whatever is most profitable, and coca cultivation happens to be most profitable for them.  this is so, speaking coldly, honestly, and sincerely.  as president of peru i have to point out that my people, the huallage region peasants, cannot be considered as criminals or as people who must be jailed for producing coca leaves.    we have exchanged these views with president barco, and we reached these conclusions.  we must also note that this matter has been handled with a great deal of publicity. after the death of carlos galan, a great colombian leader, the colombian government launched an offensive intended to find out whether the drug trafficking bands were responsible for his assassination, and the u.s. government then extended some assistance.  this assistance has been present to the world as though the united states had sent an enormous quantity of aircraft, hundreds of helicopters, and thousands of millions of dollars to colombia.  as i was able to see in bogota, only helicopters, some of which had been purchased earlier by the colombian government, were sent.  i was also informed that some of those helicopters had been used previously in peru.    i have said that, if there is that much conviction, i support president bush for defending u.s. society.  if he has that much conviction, it is hard to believe that less than one thousandth of what is spent in arms and military expenditures should be allocated to replace coca plantations and to improve the general situation in latin america.  we have talked with president barco, and i will talk with president paz zamora to see how we can exchange opinions.  then, as president bush said, a meeting of presidents will be welcome.  but the meeting should also be attended by europe, which has a fundamental interest in the future.    (correspondent) would the idea be to hold a meeting in the near future of peru, colombia, and bolivia with president bush and a representative of the eec?    (garcia) yes, because drug trafficking is a growing problem. cartels have sprouted in colombia -- monopolies that try to elect deputies and senators to influence the government.  those monopolies might extend their operations to our countries if we do not stop this growing problem. the situation can become worse in bolivia, where it was said that the drug traffickers had an influence on a dictatorial military regime.  it is not just a matter of protecting the morality of humanity; it is not just a matter of defending the united states, which has a primary role in world leadership; it is essentially a matter of defending our democracy -- the legitimacy and cleanliness of our social life.  i hope that we can have a meeting of the three presidents first, so that we can let the u.s.  president know our views on the overall problem.    (correspondent) will you propose that meeting, mr president?    (garcia) i don't want to assume a leading role.  the idea emerged in a conversation with president barco, and i will talk later with president paz zamora.    (correspondent) a meeting between you and president bush late this month has been mentioned.  is this true, mr president?    (garcia) no, i believe that has been mere speculation in the press. for the time being i have discarded the idea of making another trip abroad.  i do not see the concrete possibility of meeting with president bush, although i hope we can meet sometime before 28 july 1990.    (correspondent) changing the subject, mr president -- much has been said in recent days about the possible or probable expulsion of peru from the imf.  what is the truth about this, and what would expulsion mean?    (garcia) well, first, it is politically impossible for peru to be expelled from the imf.  second, there is misinformation and alarmism regarding the matter.  what is the imf?  it is some sort of creditor bank created in 1946 that lends money to countries with balance-of-payments problems; that is, with problems with their foreign reserves levels.  when a country has no reserves or only $100 million in reserves, it can apply for a credit from the imf to pay for imports or overdue debts.  this is the imf, an organization created to facilitate the flow of international financial resources.  an imf credit is dependent on signing a letter of intent or an adjustment program.  adjustment means reducing the country's internal consumption so as to spare the country's reserves in order to meet debt obligations.

(begin recording) (reporter) good morning, colonel.    (ochoa) good morning. thanks, raul.  these gentlemen seem to be speaking in the name of the entire armed forces.  i know well what was discussed in the meeting. someone even said that the bright idea of discharging me was considered.  they failed to take into account, however, that i am a deputy and that, as a deputy and a citizen, i am entitled to express what i feel, just as i have done.  i, who owe everything to the armed forces, who fought beside the soldiers as monterrosa, carlitos, and very few others did, never got rich when in the armed forces, as some of the commanders did, although not all of them, of course.  this undoubtedly has irritated them.    i have simply expressed my viewpoint as a soldier concerned about the armed forces' situation.  i never mentioned any names.  i simply demanded justice because, even according to military theory, i cannot conceive that such an important decision could have been made by a single person.  i still think this is a plot by some members of the institution, not by the armed forces as such.  i only have respect and love for the armed forces.  i am concerned over the delicate situation to which the institution could be led because of the actions of some nefarious members.  i have deep respect for the officers in the field, who fight every day.  of course, i must criticize those who have profited from the institution and who today have raised the roof, as if i were the one to blame and as if i were undermining the institutionality of the state.  quite the opposite is true.  my criticism is positive and intends to encourage a deeper investigation and exhaust all resources in this direction.  i would like them to stop making ridiculous demands and to stop seeking a confrontation. it is known that what i am demanding is what is being felt and said. i am not accusing anyone in particular.  i am only demanding justice. commanders' meetings should not be held to make such a statement. they should have instead shown their concern over the armed forces' situation.  i would have been very interested in seeing them take the stand to continue the investigation to the last consequences.  as the military man i am, i only assessed the situation.  i never mentioned any names, but insisted that a deeper inquiry should be made to carry out justice, because otherwise it is the institution that will suffer.    (reporter) col ochoa, after the \"sixty minutes\" program on cbs in the united states, it seems that in this capital and in the country your remarks and your interpretation of the jesuits' case were distorted.  today there has been an attempt to accuse you. it has been said that the cut in u.s. aid to the salvadoran armed forces is the result of your remarks, rather than of the slowness in the investigation of the jeusit priests' case.  do you think there has been ill intent in this, or that there has been an attempt to take advantage of you to try to justify an action?    (ochoa) i think so. there has been an attempt to blame me, as if i could influence the decision-making of the u.s. congress.  a reduction in military aid to el salvador has been under consideration for months because the expected results have not been obtained.  i think it is ridiculous and childish to say that the aid will be cut as the result of my remarks.  the truth is that all crimes with which some armed forces' members have jeopardized the institution should be punished. my understanding is that solidarity should exist in the context of operations and the fulfillment of the armed forces' constitutional mission.  however, those who harm the institution should not be protected.    i think some are trying to take advantage of the situation, as if to say: col ochoa has endangered the armed forces.  what has endangered the institution is the murder of the jesuits and the san sebastian people.  i canot agree with the perpetration of outrages. one thing is to fight fairly with the enemy.  there are dead in every war.  i said this very clearly when i was 4th infantry brigade commander in cabanas.  i agreed with the penetration into the population to help them.  i feel satisfied over my passage through the armed forces as a commander, because i identified myself both with my men and the civilian population.  at no time did i take advantage of the institution to acquire illegal riches.  to point these things out is not to attack the armed forces.  quite the contrary, it is because i love it that i have criticized the negative members.  the armed forces can thus be spared greater damage by the poor actions of some of its members.    (reporter) colonel, in the past few hours we have heard reports that you are to be supported by the army's younger officers and some unions, even the cel union.  what can you tell us about this situation?

        "doc": "the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) issued a communique a few hours ago denying that it directed an attack against supreme court of justice president mauricio gutierrez castro.    the rebel communique reads: on the afternoon of 2 july, fmln guerrillas carried out propaganda activity and occupied 8 km of the road to la libertad port, between the 14- and 21-km markers, where they erected a barricade.  the guerrillas added that they stopped approximately 200 vehicles to meet and exchange views with the drivers.    at the 14-km marker, a vehicle in which (roberto matis regalado's) bodyguards were riding arrived, but the driver did not obey the order to stop, which provoked a clash with our units.  two men were wounded and one woman was killed as a result of that incident.    our forces reported that they seized one m-16 rifle and one .45 - caliber pistol.  the fmln document adds that minutes later, at the 21-km marker, the supreme court of justice president's bodyguards tried to surprise our fighters and another clash occurred. during the clash, one bodyguard was killed and the arena (nationalist republican alliance) official was wounded.    paragraph three of the communique adds that the armed propaganda activities along the la libertad port - san salvador route are aimed at distributing propaganda and at destabilizing this vital route used by government officials and military men to travel to their private clubs located along the coast.    the fmln, the document adds, reiterates its determination to stop those who are involved in the genocidal war -- those who every day shell the rural areas and persecute and murder peasants, workers, and students -- from taking it easy and relaxing at their clubs and in their exclusive neighborhoods.  the attack on the national police station at the manuel jose arce military neighborhood follows this same line of destabilization.  therefore, we call on our people to pay attention to the recommendations and orders issued by our fighters and to thereby prevent regrettable losses.  we warn bodyguards and security guards that we will fight those who are armed and who offer resistance.    in conclusion, the fmln communique released a few hours ago adds: we reiterate that we will continue to abide by our revolutionary principles and stick to the truth.  we did not participate in incidents such as the attack against (presidency minister) antonio rodriguez porth and edgar chacon (ideologue of the orlando de sola group).  these incidents resulted from a war within arena ranks, and we warn that acts of repression unleashed by the government against the popular and democratic movements will not go unpunished and will receive a strong response from our forces.    this was the recent fmln communique on the incidents that occurred on 2 july on the road to la libertad port, where the president of the supreme court of justice was wounded.",

        "doc": "despite ample evidence, no salvadoran government had blamed the armed forces of killing defenseless civilians since the civil war worsened in 1979.  the announcement made by president alfredo cristiani of the arrest of 45 soldiers and 2 officers for killing 6 clergymen, a maid, and her daughter, on 16 november is in itself a small and partial milestone.    cristiani, whose nationalist republican alliance party was founded at the beginning of the eighties by individuals linked to paramilitary bands, the army, and security corps, asserted that the names of those responsible for the crimes will be released in the next 48 hours.    jesuist francisco estrada, who replaced father jose ignacio ellacuria -- one of those massacred -- at the rectorship of the central american university in san salvador, warned that it is not enough to know which sargent pulled the trigger but who gave him orders to do so needs to be revealed.  cristiani will not go that far.    cosmetic sacrifices are made in order to neutralize the threat of u.s. congress interrupting the $1.5 million it sends a day for the war against the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) and the repression of the people.    the dismissal of general juan rafael bustillo as chief of the air forces and the possible punishment of some of the counterinsurgent atlacatl battalion fulfill these requirements.  however, cristiani will attend the next informal summit of central american presidents in tegucigalpa, honduras on 28 january under adverse conditions.    the mobilization of the latin american public opinion against the u.s. intervention in panama and its aim of extending the intervention to other nations of the area have weakened washington's diplomatic space. this could have an effect on its political ally of el salvador which, in the previous summit held in december, presented nicaragua and the fmln as responsible for the worsening of the crisis in central america.    the facts are conclusive. what will now be the excuse of salvadoran president alfredo cristiani and his protector george bush?",

(begin recording) (ponce) our relations with the north americans are normal as usual.  the u.s. advisers have helped us very much in the professionalization of the armed forces, and they continue working with us.    (reporter) where do you think these wire reports stating there are rifts between salvadoran military officers and u.s.  advisers have orginiated?    (ponce) i do not know; i cannot understand.  there are always those who try to break the strategic alliance between the salvadoran government and armed forces and the united states.  this is a poor country that depends a great deal on u.s. economic and military aid.    (reporter) following the murder of the jesuits, what are relations like between the salvadoran military and the gringo advisers?    (ponce) as usual, these relations are very cordial, and they continue to work with us.  as you can see, two advisers are here with me now at the table presiding over the event.  the same has been the case with all the units in the country's interior.  i fail to see any difference in relations before and afterward. (end recording)    the military chief repeated the need to maintain the state of emergency, not only due to the guerrilla attacks, but also to keep control over the organization fronts just prior to an expected wave of protests on the latest government economy measures.    (begin recording) (ponce) we must start thinking what may happen to domestic order in the face of the economic measures that have been issued or are planned.  we must think what the reaction of the people or the fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front) organization fronts will be, as they always use any excuse to disrupt domestic order.  it would be good to look into what is needed to maintain domestic order in the country. (end recording)    the high-ranking military officer gave these statements at the ceremony to turn over command of the captain general gerardo barrios military academy.  the new commander is colonel ricardo alfonso casanova sandoval, who replaces colonel guillermo alfredo benavides moreno, removed from his post after being accused of ordering the murder of the jesuit priests.    meanwhile, colonel hector heriberto hernandez has been appointed commander of the 6th infantry brigade based in usulutan, and in la union department the change of command ceremonies of the armed forces military training center have taken place, where colonel francisco arturo lopez will be in command replacing colonel carlos alfredo rivas, who has been transferred to the joint chiefs of staff.",

(reporter) (words indistinct) what are you doing to prepare the commission that is to hold talks (words indistinct)?    (cristiani) the terrorists will not of course be successful with actions of this kind and will not provoke us into violent action. they should understand by now that the government is searching for peace and wants to achieve peace within el salvador's legal framework and by applying the law.  the fmln rebels should understand that their terrorist actions will not lead us to take rash actions; it is useless for them to continue to act in this way.    we are continuing our work on setting up the commission.  today we will speak with two people who have still not told us if they will accept my invitation to be commission members.  the names of the commission members will be released to the public once the commission is fully formed.    (reporter) (words indistinct) the catholic church's role in this commission?

(reporter) what would you say is the biggest obstacle you have encountered in the month that you have served as president?    (cristiani) i believe that the biggest obstacle has been our inability to launch our government program, which is due to the state of affairs existing in the former administration when we took over. we have repeatedly observed this state of affairs in the majority of government (word indistinct).  throughout government offices, disorder was rampant, and, in many cases, we have observed that government offices were managed irresponsibly.  moreover, the nation's public finances have greatly deteriorated.  we have inherited a country in very bad financial shape, and, i believe, this has delayed the launching of our government program.

(gonzalez) i believe that the cristiani government is closing all the roads to a peaceful solution of this conflict.  through repression it is closing off the possibility of labor unions and associations resolving their problems peacefully.  the government is closing off the possibility of negotiations.  the army and the cristiani government are opposed to true negotiations.  the people have no alternative.  in el salvador there is a latent path, the path of armed actions.  at this moment, as this government increases repression, armed actions become increasingly legitimate, armed actions to find solutions to the conflict, armed actions to stop the repression by the regime.    the workers and their associations and labor unions are entitled to defend themselves and their labor benefits.  defense is legitimate. it is legitimate for the workers to decide to defend themselves the armed way, through violence.  it is the cristiani government, ponce, and the high command who are leaving the workers no alternative.    (reporter) to conclude, commander: in recent hours there have been attacks in the capital, including bomb attacks on the residences of democratic leaders such as ruben zamora and aronete diaz, an attack on the residence of colonel carranza, and an attack on a relative of colonel lopez huila, among others.  the armed forces and the government have publicly said that the fmln is responsible for these attacks.    (gonzalez) our armed actions are highly just and have political motivations.  our objectives are strictly military.  all our guerrilla units function according to this principle, be it in the rural areas or in the cities where our urban commandos operate.    the attack on the armed forces staff installations and other operations against military targets are our responsibility.  the fmln's policy is not to attack relatives of military men or politicians.  the high command has been trying to confuse the people here and abroad.  what is its objective?  to cover up its repressive policy.  it is escalating its actions.  it has gone from the selective capture and murder of leaders to mass arrests, and from mass arrests it has moved into genocide and indiscriminate attacks.    it is clear that its objective is the social organizations.  the government said it in san jose.  it is evident that the high command is trying to create confusion, but the people abroad and we know that our actions are aimed at military objectives.",

(begin recording) (merino) what they are showing is that they are bent on carrying out totally destructive actions to lower the confidence of the population and to provoke general panic.  i think that although as a government we have always maintained a conciliatory position to attain peace in el salvador, we must also make a firmer decision to take stronger action.  the people who commit these wanton actions are deranged people.  they do not understand words.  they do not understand that they must respect a legal system, or a democratic process or one of humanization.  they are simply beasts and murderers and must be treated as such.  (end recording)    merino said the murderers must be punished with the full weight of the laws, and that one of the terrorists who was wounded and captured at the site of the crime is under interrogation.    (begin recording) (merino) one of the criminals was wounded.  this will obviously enable us to obtain some clues as to the identity of the actual killers and of the masterminds of this new murder, which has shocked salvadoran society.    as in previous cases, we are conducting investigations in this case.  however, i repeat that the time has come for us to take a firmer stand, to do our utmost, and to realize that if nothing has happened to us thus far, it does not mean we will not fall victim to these murderers.  it is better to take precautions now than to have regrets later.  (end recording)    merino said that this campaign of violence promoted by the terrorist hordes has not ended.  clear evidence of this is this brutal and cowardly murder, which has again filled the suffering salvadoran people with sorrow.",

(reporter) did you know that the government was going to make this announcement last night, or was it a surprise?    (estrada) i think it was a surprise because we had been in touch with the president and with the crime commission, which is the one carrying out the investigations on orders from the president and the government.  they promised us that if we were to cooperate by providing information, they would do everything possible to resolve the problem and carry out the investigations.    at that point i was skeptical, because the persons who have testified have accused the armed forces, and i had never seen a salvadoran president or the armed forces making a serious effort to clean up its image and carry out investigtions to put members of the armed forces in prison.  i was skeptical.  i had never seen that happen, but facts show that i was mistaken. (end recording)    father estrada has admitted that there has been international pressure to have this case investigated, but he optimistically believes that the decision to investigate has been adopted also for the sake of the prestige of the armed forces.

        "doc": "is there any unrest because of some of the laws passed by congress?    (azcona) no, there is no unrest because of laws passed by congress. some measures that have affected income have been adopted, but we will make progress anyhow.    (giron) will you ask that some of these laws be reconsidered?    (azcona) no, i am not going to do that.  there is, however, the law on coffee taxes which could be discussed with producers because the law-decree on coffee is very drastic.  however, the country is making progress, and economic activities in various sectors--commerce, construction, and manufacturing--are on the increase.  some sectors have some problems, but i believe we are going to resolve those problems.    (giron) do you have economic advisers, mr president?    (azcona) any person consulted is an economic adviser.  the main economic advisers, however, are those in the government.    (giron) it is being said that politically speaking you have been left on your own.  is this how you see it also?    (azcona) no way.  how could i be alone? on the contrary, we are doing well.  i believe we are going to receive more support.  i do not see why i could be left alone.  there is the government and the experts.  we are establishing relations with the party, with the most important people of the party.    (giron) are employees going to be pressured?    (azcona) i do not believe they are going to be forced to do anything because no law says that the employees of a government must support any particular party.  however, i believe that if the executive branch works in unison, as it has been doing, then all members of the liberal party will be happy to make contributions to the party to guarantee a new victory.    (giron) would you support reforms to the electoral law?    (azcona) we discussed that issue today.  apparently the national convention, which is the party's top authority, has approved some reforms.    (giron) do you agree with internal elections taking place simultaneously (as heard)?    (azcona) i believe it would be beneficial if they take place in one single day, but we did not discuss that today, and i do not want to discuss details about that.    (giron) do you believe that either your government or yourself could have been politically harmed by the latest crisis endured by the country?    (azcona) i do not think so.  i think that what happened will benefit the country.  acts of violence are regrettable, but those that have taken place have shown that we in honduras are not immune to violence. the same day incidents were taking place here, 13 persons died in san salvador as a result of a bomb explosion.  the loss of lives is unfortunate and violence against a building and facilities next to the u.s. embassy is regrettable because this does not help the country.    (giron) have you talked with u.s. government officials about an indemnity?  it is being said that damage amounts to $6 million.    (azcona) no, we have nothing about $6 million.  what we have received is a note from the u.s. ambassador the day after the incidents.  they are entitled to file a protest.  the note says that later there will be a (words indistinct).    honduras signed the geneva convention on the responsibility of governments when actions are carried out against diplomatic installations.    (giron) the forcing of radio stations to join a radio network and the imposing of a state of emergency have been the source of much criticism against your government.    (azcona) i have heard some criticism because of the network. perhaps we had it for a few hours too many.  regarding the state of emergency, however, the people have responded positively because one more casualty would have had negative effects.  the state of emergency made it possible for people to cool down, and those on the streets returned to their homes.  i feel it was beneficial.  the declaration of emergency decree was based on the constitution and on presidential authority.  congress was informed about this.    i believe this was a positive measure, and this is how the people have viewed it, positively.    (giron) do you believe the situation has been overcome?    (azcona) we do not know if the situation is over.  i think so.  i believe that what happened is that tempers got hot for a moment, and that some sectors, which i do not want to name because they have been identified by the people, took advantage of this.  perhaps some people tried to make political gains and the situation got out of hand.    i believe, however, that everything is more or less quiet.  the government is talking with the various sectors.  there is a small strike by a small group of health workers.  checks with salary increases covering a 4-month period will be paid today.  some readjustments will be made to favor some employees who have not received the increases we had promised.    we want to appeal to health sector labor unions to set aside any confrontational attitude because the government is meeting and will meet all its commitments.    (giron) what can you tell us about the latest incidents with nicaragua?    (azcona) these are not the first incidents.  i believe incidents will continue happening.  however, the government is prepared to enforce respect for the country's sovereignty.  (end recording)",

        "doc": "colombian officials report that guerrillas presumed to be members of the pro-castro army of national liberation (eln) today once again dynamited the cano limon-covenas oil pipeline, colombia's major oil pipeline.    an ecopetrol (colombian petroleum enterprise) spokesman said that the explosion took place at km - 102 of the pipe near benadia in arauca intendancy, in the eastern part of the country.    this attack takes place 25 days after a previous guerrilla action, which interrupted the pumping of crude through the 780 - km long pipeline.  on 16 june, the eln destroyed the cano limon-covenas oil terminal on colombia's atlantic coast, in what is considered the most serious attack against colombia's petroleum industry in its history. since that time, colombia has been forced to suspend an average of 180,000 of the 220,000 daily barrels of crude piped through the country's leading pipeline.    today's attack is the 25th during 1989, and the third this week, the ecopetrol spokesman revealed.  the eln's attacks have reduced the nation's hydrocarbon production this year by 20 percent, with losses exceeding $180 million.  the eln has dynamited the cano limon-covenas pipeline 125 times since january 1988, causing losses of more than $450 million as a result of oil spills, halted production, the suspension of exports, and ecological damage, the ecopetrol spokesman added.    during the 25 years of its armed struggle, the eln -- led by former spanish priest manuel perez -- has intensified its attacks against the petroleum infrastructure, arguing that it perpetrates these actions \"to prevent the exploitation of colombia's natural resources.\"",
