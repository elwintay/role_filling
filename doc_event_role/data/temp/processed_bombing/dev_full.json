        "doc": "the army of national liberation (eln) has announced in a communique sent to antonio roldan betancur, governor of the northwestern antioquia department, that it rejects the peace plan proposed by the government and that it will continue armed attacks, it was learned a few hours ago.    according to initial reports, the armed movement--the most radical of the guerrilla groups in the country--sent the message through luis mesa puerta, a police inspector of el tigre, who was kidnaped last friday for this purpose.    roldan betancur did not disclose any more details and merely confirmed that the castroite eln, which has staged several dynamite attacks against oil installations, did not accept the proposal made by president virgilio barco vargas' government.    meanwhile, the m-19 sent a letter a few hours ago to misael pastrana borrero, a former president and member of the opposition social conservative party (psc), requesting that his party actively participate in a new peace initiative that formally began the 2d week of january.    at that time, on behalf of the government, rafael pardo rueda--the presidential adviser for peace--and the top m-19 commander, carlos pizarro leon gomez, signed a preliminary agreement that contemplates the beginning of a direct dialogue between the guerrilla groups and spokesmen of the political parties represented in parliament.    however, the farc, which declared a unilateral truce to faciliate the beginning of the conversations, said that these agreements were \"exclusive,\" as they were signed by only one of the country's rebel movements.    the document signed by the government and the m-19 specifies that the tasks with all the rebel organizations are conducted through the simon bolivar national guerrilla coordinating board (cngsb).  however, with the eln announcement, a joint agreement has been ruled out.    meanwhile, prior to leaving today for caracas where he will attend the inauguration of carlos andres perez, the president held a meeting with the chiefs of the two traditional parties, former presidents julio cesar turbay of the ruling liberal party, and pastrana borrero, of the psc.    the meeting held at the narino palace (seat of the government) was called so that barco vargas could report to the psc on the development of the most recent events concerning the new peace process that began with the m-19.    according to some political circles, in this manner the path toward peace might be cleared, inasmuch as one of the \"reservations\" the psc had was that the barco vargas government did not consult with the parties on the negotiations.",

(garcia) as president of all peruvians -- and of vargas llosa to even if he does not like it -- i cannot pass judgment, either ethically or intellectually, on a politician and peruvian who is contending for the presidency.    (reporter) what are you going to do after you step down from the presidency?    (garcia) well, i am going to be free.    (amat) why do you not come to colombia and i am sure...    (garcia, interrupting) sure, i accept your invitation, and i hope some colombians will extend it.  however, i want to tell you very honestly, that i am perhaps better at selling dreams, ideas, and doctrines than at administering a situation of penury, like the one our countries are experiencing, and most particularly peru, which is one of the poorest countries in latin america.  it is very difficult. for instance, on a day when the price of rice or chicken goes up, the people will not believe you, even if you tell them the greatest of truths.  one can be preaching something very important, but if it failed to rain and the city had no water no one will believe of you the greatest of all truths.  then, when one stops being president and administering penury, one can devote oneself to convincing people, to educating.  that is what i should do.    (amat) now, why did you make that aside, making me president of all peruvians, even of vargas llosa?  whether he likes or not it hurts him.    (garcia) because i am sure that some people would not like to have me as president.  (laughter)    (amat) even him, for instance?    (garcia) i did not say so.  i do not know.  i never fall to the level of defining people or pointing out last names.  i make an outline or define them in the negative.    (amat) mr. president, (words indistinct) this dialogue (words indistinct) for your generosity and kindness.  addressing our people and our country, (words indistinct), how were things today at the summit?    (garcia) very well.  colombians, who have seen their institution threatened, their press abused, and many politicians also threatened, must have confidence that latin america, together with the united states, will confront the problem of drug trafficking.  this is not only a problem for colombia.  it is our problem too, and we will tackle it.  the day a newspaper was blown up in bogota i came to bogota because i felt that freedom of the press was threatened on the continent.  after all, we are latin americans.  let colombians have confidence.",

(gonzalez) our armed actions are highly just and have political motivations.  our objectives are strictly military.  all our guerrilla units function according to this principle, be it in the rural areas or in the cities where our urban commandos operate.    the attack on the armed forces staff installations and other operations against military targets are our responsibility.  the fmln's policy is not to attack relatives of military men or politicians.  the high command has been trying to confuse the people here and abroad.  what is its objective?  to cover up its repressive policy.  it is escalating its actions.  it has gone from the selective capture and murder of leaders to mass arrests, and from mass arrests it has moved into genocide and indiscriminate attacks.    it is clear that its objective is the social organizations.  the government said it in san jose.  it is evident that the high command is trying to create confusion, but the people abroad and we know that our actions are aimed at military objectives.",

(studio reporter) can you confirm the arrival of the police's bomb squad?  authorities fear the crash may have been caused by an explosion rather than an accident inside the airplane.    (reporter) the f-2 judicial police and criminal statistics experts are here.  they feel that the accident may have been caused by a terrorist action.  the remark was made based on witness accounts. they noted that this may have been a terrorist attack because airplanes do not have this kind of accident unless there is an explosion, something that has very serious consequences.  according to reports by the national police f-2 experts, the airplane broke into six pieces.  it is completely destroyed, which is why the 106 passengers aboard are strewn across an area 6-8 km wide.    access to the airplane's remains is difficult because this is a mountainous region.  the casquito (word indistinct) is through the road that goes from bosa, cundinamarca department, to the school (not further identified).  authorities say that this area is located very close to sluice number 3, muna 3, which feeds water to the dam.  the situation is very difficult and dramatic.  right now, experts are collecting samples and trying find all they can to learn for sure if this was a terrorist action or a serious accident caused by a flaw in the mechanical system of the hk-1803 airplane.",

        "doc": "is there any unrest because of some of the laws passed by congress?    (azcona) no, there is no unrest because of laws passed by congress. some measures that have affected income have been adopted, but we will make progress anyhow.    (giron) will you ask that some of these laws be reconsidered?    (azcona) no, i am not going to do that.  there is, however, the law on coffee taxes which could be discussed with producers because the law-decree on coffee is very drastic.  however, the country is making progress, and economic activities in various sectors--commerce, construction, and manufacturing--are on the increase.  some sectors have some problems, but i believe we are going to resolve those problems.    (giron) do you have economic advisers, mr president?    (azcona) any person consulted is an economic adviser.  the main economic advisers, however, are those in the government.    (giron) it is being said that politically speaking you have been left on your own.  is this how you see it also?    (azcona) no way.  how could i be alone? on the contrary, we are doing well.  i believe we are going to receive more support.  i do not see why i could be left alone.  there is the government and the experts.  we are establishing relations with the party, with the most important people of the party.    (giron) are employees going to be pressured?    (azcona) i do not believe they are going to be forced to do anything because no law says that the employees of a government must support any particular party.  however, i believe that if the executive branch works in unison, as it has been doing, then all members of the liberal party will be happy to make contributions to the party to guarantee a new victory.    (giron) would you support reforms to the electoral law?    (azcona) we discussed that issue today.  apparently the national convention, which is the party's top authority, has approved some reforms.    (giron) do you agree with internal elections taking place simultaneously (as heard)?    (azcona) i believe it would be beneficial if they take place in one single day, but we did not discuss that today, and i do not want to discuss details about that.    (giron) do you believe that either your government or yourself could have been politically harmed by the latest crisis endured by the country?    (azcona) i do not think so.  i think that what happened will benefit the country.  acts of violence are regrettable, but those that have taken place have shown that we in honduras are not immune to violence. the same day incidents were taking place here, 13 persons died in san salvador as a result of a bomb explosion.  the loss of lives is unfortunate and violence against a building and facilities next to the u.s. embassy is regrettable because this does not help the country.    (giron) have you talked with u.s. government officials about an indemnity?  it is being said that damage amounts to $6 million.    (azcona) no, we have nothing about $6 million.  what we have received is a note from the u.s. ambassador the day after the incidents.  they are entitled to file a protest.  the note says that later there will be a (words indistinct).    honduras signed the geneva convention on the responsibility of governments when actions are carried out against diplomatic installations.    (giron) the forcing of radio stations to join a radio network and the imposing of a state of emergency have been the source of much criticism against your government.    (azcona) i have heard some criticism because of the network. perhaps we had it for a few hours too many.  regarding the state of emergency, however, the people have responded positively because one more casualty would have had negative effects.  the state of emergency made it possible for people to cool down, and those on the streets returned to their homes.  i feel it was beneficial.  the declaration of emergency decree was based on the constitution and on presidential authority.  congress was informed about this.    i believe this was a positive measure, and this is how the people have viewed it, positively.    (giron) do you believe the situation has been overcome?    (azcona) we do not know if the situation is over.  i think so.  i believe that what happened is that tempers got hot for a moment, and that some sectors, which i do not want to name because they have been identified by the people, took advantage of this.  perhaps some people tried to make political gains and the situation got out of hand.    i believe, however, that everything is more or less quiet.  the government is talking with the various sectors.  there is a small strike by a small group of health workers.  checks with salary increases covering a 4-month period will be paid today.  some readjustments will be made to favor some employees who have not received the increases we had promised.    we want to appeal to health sector labor unions to set aside any confrontational attitude because the government is meeting and will meet all its commitments.    (giron) what can you tell us about the latest incidents with nicaragua?    (azcona) these are not the first incidents.  i believe incidents will continue happening.  however, the government is prepared to enforce respect for the country's sovereignty.  (end recording)",
