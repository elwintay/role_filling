(cristiani) at approximately 0530 this morning, three explosives were hurled at his residence from an empty lot.  the explosives caused extensive damage to the residence.  there was rifle fire too, but the rifle fire was only to distract security personnel in the area.    the attackers acted like animals.  mr merino is still in the united states with his wife.  he will be returning this afternoon.  their four children and three of the children's friends were at the residence when the attack took place.  the children could have been killed.  those who carried out this attack are people who for a long time have been talking about human rights and about indiscriminate bombings.  this attack endangered civilians.  thank goodness only one of the children was wounded.  one of the girls who was visiting the home was hit by some shrapnel but the wound is not serious.  right now we are getting a doctor to examine the children to see if their hearing has been damaged because two of the devices exploded in the bedroom the children were in.    i believe this is another indication that the fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front), far from seeking peace and wanting peace for the salvadoran people, wants to continue its terrorism, its killings -- its irrational killings.  i believe that little can be achieved in the search for peace through dialogue because these people are not sincere when they claim that they want to resolve the problem.    the salvadoran people are tired of violence.  they stated their opinion on 19 march.  the fmln should think carefully because the people have flatly rejected violence and the fmln.  i do not believe that the members of our party will be frightened into abandoning the struggle for the consolidation of democracy, which is something the people want.    i believe that those who want to make the fmln look like martyrs and like persons who work for the good of the people, should know the truth:  they are nothing but savages who lack human qualities and who are indiscriminately killing and wounding civilians who have nothing to do with the conflict.

(sentence as published) alvarado was killed by a bomb presumably placed by an urban guerrilla group on top of his armored vehicle as it stopped at an intersection in san miguelito neighborhood, north of the capital.    the fmln is abandoning \"guerrilla warfare tactics in rural areas and increasingly resorting to the establishment of civilian fronts in the main cities and to urban terrorism in an attempt to destabilize (the government).  at the international level, the guerrillas are trying to elicit negative reaction toward the new government to isolate us politically from the world,\" cristiani said.  vice president-elect francisco merino accompanied him.    he added: \"obviously, if warranted by the situation, we must resort to legal mechanisms.  should the situation become difficult or impossible to control, our harsher measure would be to declare a state of siege.\"    since early april, the fmln has been carrying out a strong offensive against private companies and the banking system and has stepped up sabotage actions against telephone and electricity networks.    in addition to the attack on the attorney general, there were other attacks, in which guerrilla deserter miguel castellanos and francisco pecorrini, both of whom were right-wing ideologues, were killed and carlos mendoza, chief editor of analisis magazine, was wounded.  castellanos and pecorrini were connected with that magazine.",

(begin recording) (d'aubuisson, in progress) ... fallacies. this is not the first time they have claimed to want something and ended up doing something different.  they are going to try to improve their international image and do not want to look like (word indistinct) before the little mangy-dogs who go about planting bombs here.  they want to demonstrate perhaps that they always hold a hegemonic position here and will try to obtain a better negotiating position for their illegal forces, which are still going around (word indistinct) and killing people (words indistinct).    (castillo) nevertheless, major, do you view this meeting as positive (word indistinct) with the fmln -- that is, the dialogue -- now that something tangible has come out of the summit?  do you think peace can be achieved?    (d'aubuisson) the objective of all salvadorans -- and in this regard we speak from the heart -- is to achieve peace.  if the fmln cooperates, we welcome its cooperation.  however, if it does not cooperate, there will be fmln members who will demobilize, the same way so many people from the (word indistinct) are deserting.  these people had to be given guarantees.  we will see later if, as they say, they are truly working, or struggling, for the salvadoran people (words indistinct) more positive actions.    however, we see everything as being well on the way to achieving peace in a short time.  (end recording)    d'aubuisson said that if the fmln does not agree to the demobilization, the fmln members will be solely responsible if peace is not achieved. regarding the commission, he said it is already being organized and will begin a dialogue soon.    (begin recording) (d'aubuisson, in progress) ...a continuous dialogue to find solutions.  that is why president cristiani has instructed that it have no prior agenda but that it just begin.  their first step should be to sit down at a table to talk, to negotiate, to engage in dialogue.  and this is to go on continuously until solutions are found and they achieve something tangible, which is the final solution.    (reporter) (words indistinct)     (d'aubuisson) well, for example, costa rican president arias has offered to act as mediator or intermediary.  he said that if the commission goes to san jose, he will take it upon himself to invite these gentlemen too and to give them whatever they need for this meeting to begin.  after that, they themselves will develop the mechanisms.  (end recording)    maj d'aubuisson said the commission will be sworn in and will maintain an ongoing dialogue with the fmln representatives.    commenting on legislative work, he said that today the political committee will meet to elect the president of the commission on corruption, which had been substantially neglected by dr jaime ventura.  the only candidate for the presidency of the commission on corruption is deputy roberto angulo, vice president and acting president of the legislative assembly.",

        "doc": "the medellin cartel reacted with a campaign of attacks to u.s.  president george bush's antidrug program.  as of this morning the speech had not elicited any official comment on the part of the colombian presidency.    only communications minister carlos elmos stated in very general terms that the problem continues to be \"fundamentally that of the consumption in the united states,\" which he added must \"punish the consumers.\"    shortly after president bush's speech, a wave of attacks shook medellin, the general headquarters of the country's principal drug traffickers.  according to a police report issued today 11 persons, including 2 newsmen, were wounded in the attacks.    the bogota newspapers dedicated their main headlines this morning to the u.s.  president's speech.  in general they compared his speech to a declaration of war: \"bush wages war (el espectador), \"bush declares war\" (el siglo), \"8 billion against drugs\" (el tiempo).    the newspapers did not dedicate any editorial to bush's speech, but limited themselves to publishing excerpts of his speech, taking special note of the 5-year $2 billion aid plan for colombia, peru, and bolivia.    the colombian television stations, which had announced that they would carry a live broadcast of the overall antidrug plan, finally ended up only transmitting excerpts of the speech on a delayed basis, without explaining the reason for the change of plans.    only caracol radio rebroadcast the text of president bush's speech on a delayed basis with a simultaneous spanish translation.    despite the curfew implemented 1 week ago in medellin and the major military presence in the country's second largest city, two bank branches and a restaurant were blown up while a restaurant was burned.",

(begin recording) (unidentified speaker) there were four men in a pickup, two seated in front and two in the back.  the two who were in the back took out the bazookas and fired on the garrison's gate.  a man driving a suzuki drove at the same time the rockets were launched and he was hit.    (reporter) how many people were in the vehicle?    (unidentified speaker) four.  the car where the injured man was? only one person, the man who was injured.    (reporter) how many people were in the vehicle from where the rockets where fired?    (unidentified speaker) four persons.    (reporter) at what time did that happen?    (unidentified speaker) about 30 minutes ago, at approximately 1530.    (reporter) how many rockets were fired?    (unidentified speaker) two.    (second unidentified speaker) the man was in the car.  after the devices exploded -- we do not know what kind were fired -- there was smoke and gunpowder all over the place.  his clothes and body were totally destroyed.  when we took him to the rosales hospital we talked to a doctor, and he said that they were going to do all they could to save his life.  (end recording)    meanwhile, colonel francisco elena fuentes, commander of the military garrison, regretted the attack and said that these attacks are within the framework of the violence unleashed in the past few days by groups that are out of control.    (begin recording) (fuentes) you have already seen the vehicle.  we believe the rockets were aimed at the gate, at the guards standing at the entrance of the headquarters.  perhaps they were aimed at me because i had been in the area 5 minutes earlier.    those people are completely out of their minds.  they do not care if the kill innocent civilians.  these could be groups that the fmln can no longer control or perhaps they are only killers who only know how to murder people.  (end recording)    the injured persons were taken to rosales hospital in san salvador where they were given emergency treatment.  the street vendor says that it was a miracle that she was not killed.    (begin recording) (perez) i do not know what happened.  i was just sitting there and i heard the noise (words indistinct).  (end recording)    meanwhile, the fmln urban guerrillas set fire to a public bush in santa marta, san jacinton neighborhood.  the rebels distributed leaflets stating that they burned the bus in reprisal for the killing of leftist leader fede elizabeth velasquez.",

(begin recording) (henriquez) good afternoon.  president augusto pinochet this morning left the higher institute of commerce where he went to vote, angry with chileans and clearly upset by the presence of international observers and journalists.  the head of state walked from the la moneda palace to the higher institute of commerce, which is at the intersection of amunategui and moneda streets.  he was accompanied by the interior minister, the minister secretary general of government, the presidential general secretary, and the chief of the military household.  he greeted general carlos parera, the military commander of the metropolitan region, and the santiago mayor. pinochet then went to voting table no 1 where he was scheduled to vote.  he saw dozens of foreign television cameramen, photographers, and journalists.    before entering the voting booth, pinochet said he was in very good spirits and very happy.    after voting, pinochet said he was very satisfied because this meant the end of the mission he began on 11 september 1973.  he added that he expected the election to develop as calmly as usual.  when a u.s. newswoman approached him for an interview, pinochet, irritated, asked her what she was doing putting her nose in here; he told her that this is our problem, not yours, intruders.  pinochet then turned to the local newsmen and told them that he is unhappy with chileans for allowing foreign observers to enter the country.    (pinochet) i am unhappy with chileans because they have lost their feeling of nationality by accepting the presence of a bunch of outsiders who have come to look over what we are doing.  what do they think they are doing?  let me tell you something else: these outsiders are here to check on the way in which their money has been invested by the political parties and these gentlemen (a reference to opposition candidates in general).    (henriquez) as he was leaving the voting site, pinochet told a uruguayan correspondent that the observers are intruders.    interior minister carlos caceres affirmed that the situation around the country remains normal and orderly.  he added that the only incident was the bomb explosion at the el salvadoran embassy and a minor incident that took place this morning in the locality of maria pinto.  caceres said that he will remain all day at the la moneda palace in order to brief president pinochet on the voting proceedings and any security problem that might arise.    finally, he said that the head of state will also stay in his office.  this afternoon pinochet will probably visit the vote counting center of the interior ministry on monategui street.  good afternoon.

        "doc": "the annals of the colombian port of cartagena list three extremely fierce sieges.  back in 1586, the \"jewel of the caribbean\" was captured by sir francis drake, who did not burn the city to the ground only because he received a ransom of 10 million pesos.  a century later cartagena was occupied by the french.  finally, in 1741, the city's defenders successfully fought off an assault by a host of 27,000 pirates headed by sir edward vernon...    the western press described the meeting between the presidents of the united states, bolivia, colombia, and peru held a few days ago in cartagena as a kind of assault.  despite some exaggeration, this graphic description was based on perfectly serious grounds.  after all, the conference did discuss immediate tasks and even a detailed schedule for a joint offensive by the governments of these countries against criminal drug trafficking, which ranks first in the pecking order of crime.    it is indeed necessary to launch an assault against the drug mafia's strongholds, whether in medellin, \"famous\" for unbridled gangsterism, or in cartagena itself, whose status as a resort is threatened by the selfsame \"cocaine barons.\"  as a matter of fact, this tourist center has been repeatedly shaken in recent months by the explosions of bombs planted by terrorists in the \"hilton\" hotel, in stores, or at its marinas.  it is no wonder, as reuter reports, that not a single cruise ship has dropped anchor there this season.    yes, the situation is highly alarming, and this applies to the whole of colombia and even to the entire region.  in these conditions the firm resolve displayed by the participants in the cartagena meeting deserves understanding and support: the resolve to finally pool their efforts in the struggle against organized crime and to jointly place a reliable barrier in its path.  these are the intentions shown in the joint statement signed by the four presidents and by the series of special documents.    the aim of these agreements is noble indeed: to besiege the drug mafia in its nests, to cut off the \"laundering\" of drug dollars, and to deprive the merchants of \"slow death\" of broad access to the \"black market\" in the united states, where, as a matter of fact, the lion's share of south america's poisonous export is consumed.  in other words, an important step has been taken to combat one of the main \"evils of the 20th century,\" and it was not for nothing that the meeting's results were positively appraised by un secretary general j. perez de cuellar.    here is a different question: emphasis in cartagena was placed on administrative and police measures and on washington's primarily militarized forms of cooperation with the andean states, but does this conform with their long-term national interests, with their desire to put an end to backwardness and attain a qualitatively new level of socioeconomic development?  after all, a radical solution of the drug problem primarily demands neither combat aircraft not armored personnel carriers, but something quite different.  it is necessary to change the economic profile of vast provinces where the cultivation of coca and marijuana is the sole source of the population's existence.    true enough, the united states has now expressed readiness to assist also in this sphere.  on the other hand, there is an almost total lack of readiness to import from south america the crops which could, in principle, squeeze out coca and marijuana.  it was not for nothing that colombia's president virgilio barco, the white house's closest ally in the struggle against drugs, was forced to declare in cartagena that the u.s. government's rigid protectionist measures are jeopardizing the very future of \"alternative\" sectors of tropical crop farming -- the cultivation of coffee, flowers, and sugar cane.  and so the \"senior partner\" appears to be tightening with the one hand the vise in which the drug mafia now finds itself, while using the other hand to protect its market from legal latin american exports.    finally, the last but, i think, most substantive argument. actually, it also casts an unfavorable light on the role of consistent fighter against the drug mafia which washington has now assumed.  this argument is perfectly encapsulated in just one short word: \"panama.\" indeed, did the recent aggression against this sovereign state, one of whose main motives was actually \"to punish the drug business bosses,\" not demonstrate all the flaws of washington's \"strongarm approach\" toward latin america?  and are there any guarantees that the pentagon will not start \"copying\" its panamanian experience in other countries in the continent on the pretext of pursuing the \"cocaine barons\"?    these are far from rhetorical questions, and it is a pity that cartagena simply failed to provide even the slightest clear-cut answers to them.",

        "doc": "and, therefore, it does not seem like it is a total advancement in a democratic process, because obviously it is not very democratic to have the armed forces of a country under the control of one of its political parties.  the armed forces of a country should respond to the democratic process and to the government that is legitimately elected by the people.  and therefore, this would curtail the freedom of choice of the nicaraguan people in trying to control and govern the country, even though it is not from the position of being president of the country.  secondly, i think that i have mentioned before that it is not the result of the election that will change our attitude with respect to our diplomatic relations with nicaragua, but rather the attitude of the nicaraguan government with respect to aid to the fmln, to the marxist guerrillas in el salvador. and in this case we still have not seen that change taking place. obviously, we feel that with mrs chamorro as president of nicaragua that this aid will stop and therefore make it easier for the resumption of normal relations between el salvador and nicaragua, but it is that attitude that would make a change and not necessarily the result in itself.    with respect to the third question, obviously i think that if mrs chamorro really is in control, in total control, especially of the sandinista army, that there will be a stop in aid, and therefore the fmln would not have nicaragua's logistical and military support for them.  and therefore, this certainly affects them.    (reporter, in english) i think that about one week ago or two weeks ago in the washington post there was a report that colonel benavides was living a rather luxurious life.  i do not know if you have seen that piece.  and also the u.s. ambassador william walker has said that he felt that it was time that, well, the article implies that there was some pressure, or there was some protection coming from the tandona (reference to the 1966 graduating class of the captain general gerardo barrios military academy) to protect benavides, because he (words indistinct) their men and that some lower lieutenants were not going to be receiving any sort of protection and they may have to take the fault for what has happened.  and also william walker had said that he felt that it was time for some of the people in the tandona to step down and for other officers to move up.  what do you think about that (word indistinct)?  should there be that kind of pressure? should some of the guys in the tandona step down from their posts?    (cristiani, in english) well, i think that it is not really the determining factor whether you belong to a specific graduating class within the armed forces that should be what determines whether you continue or not, or be removed or not from the armed forces.  it is your own performance and your own behavior that should be the determining factor.    so, therefore, it is not necessarily that the tandona people, just for being members of the graduating class, (chuckles) that action should be taken against them.  so i think that in that case that is not really the point.    with respect to the other case, i think it is now in the hands of the judicial system in the country on how it goes, what type of defense those that have been arraigned have.  i think that they all are receiving the legal support in the case and the other (words indistinct).    (reporter, in english) as for the dialogue with the guerrillas, before you left for taiwan you conditioned the dialogue on a ceasing of acts of violence.  to be specific, does this mean (words indistinct) all acts of violence?  and also, when do you think that this dialogue can actually take place?    (cristiani, in english) well, if we could try and put into one basket and call that basket with a name with respect to the actions, we are asking the fmln to stop terrorist activities, because terrorist activity is affecting the civilian population.  you just mentioned the fact about a pole that they use for electrical distribution in the country.  just last night they blew up one and there are two people hurt.  two civilians that were passing by were hurt by that explosion. so that is what has to stop.  the fmln has to stop all terrorist activity, because that is the activity that hurts the civilian population.  that is not military activity.  that is something geared against or to confront the armed forces.  so it is that violence that can be summed up in what is called terrorism that we are asking for -- those activities that really affect the civilian population of the country.

(ponce) taking into account the fact that current violent actions might come from groups outside the control of fmln leaders, we believe that the country's situation is not normal enough to say that there is no violence.  however, as a contribution to that propitious atmosphere for the dialogue, i believe that it is advisable to lift it.    (reporter) i have two questions: what is the armed forces' position regarding (words indistinct)?    (ponce) as for the first question, you are referring to statements by the president of the republic.  i believe that in due time he will have the opportunity to explain those statements.  i understand that the newsman distorted his words, but the president himself will have an opportunity to make the respective clarification.    i will, however, state that according to the reports that have been issued by the director general of the national police as to whether at any time colonel benavides has left the hands of the national police, he clearly said that at no time has benavides done this.  he is under the orders of the 4th penal judge, and at no time has the 4th penal judge authorized col. benavides to leave the confines of the jail.    the person who made the accusations should present some evidence, a photograph for example.  otherwise, this is all mere speculation. that is a very delicate case, and speculations cast a negative image on the armed forces and the country itself, and even on the administration of justice in our country.    concerning what could happen in the trial of the murder of the jesuits, the justice authorities will determine what will be done.  we will respect that decision.

        "doc": "the peruvian police, and parts of the army, have received orders of \"strict confinement to barracks\" in view of the 17 may anniversary of the terrorist organization shining path.  the organization has announced it will celebrate its 10th anniversary with an increase in armed operations.    peruvian authorities have discovered that the group that rebelled on 17 may 1980 has devised \"a celebrations plan\" and that it intends to implement the plan as \"a sign of victory\" in the \"struggle of movements,\" an ideology inspired in mao zedong's doctrine.    army personnel have been confined to barracks since the night of 12 may and have already participated on joint operations with the police to arrest 500 alleged terrorists.    in lima, 8,000 police agents and a special antiexplosives squad launched \"a gigantic operation\" of \"blockades and saturation.\"    a police spokesman told efe that they had orders \"to carefully comb the new urban areas and search for suspected criminals, arms, explosives, or subversive material.\"    according to the spokesman, the lima police department headed by general osvaldo diaz has orders \"to watch roads entering the city, to install emergency check points in strategic locations, and to report on anything unusual.\"    according to official sources, the operation will continue until after the runoff election, which is expected to be held on 10 june.    the police have launched similar operations in regions where guerrilla activity is rampant such as ayacucho, puno, huancayo, and huancavelica in the peruvian central highlands.  these regions are all under states of emergency and under military control.    shining path, considered one of the most impenetrable and orthodox armed movements in latin america, began celebrating its anniversary in lima last week by burning 11 state transport company buses. the buses were attacked by hooded individuals thought to be shining path militants.    on 11 may a bomb destroyed a building owned by the family of the mayor of lima.  in another incident in lima today, police corporal oswaldo palomino, who served in ayacucho until a short time ago, was shot to death.    in ayacucho, where the the comunist party of peru -- \"official\" name of shining path -- was born and developed, two people were murdered, and various home-made bombs exploded in in the last 24 hours.    councilmen juan manuel garabito from piura, 1,100 km north of lima, has also been shot to death. authorities blamed shining path for these attacks.    observers of the peruvian guerrilla movement told efe that the growing tide of violence attibuted to shining path indicates that the radical, or \"red\" sector, of the rebel group has taken control of the organization.    according to the sources, two different factions within the organization clashed over the celebration of the group's anniversary: the younger and radical sectors favored purely military operations while the older sector, or \"blacks,\" favored more political and historic activities.    shining path, which officially operates with approximately 5,000 armed men, has caused the death of 20,000 people, including 7,000 civilians, and it is responsible for $17 billion in direct damages to the country over its 10 year history.",
