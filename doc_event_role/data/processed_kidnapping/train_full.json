(begin recording) (gonzalez) my impression during my 2 days of captivity is that they attach great importance to a debate on the nation's oil policy.  they demand that this debate be carried out through a council meeting, which would include representatives from the government, labor unions -- particularly the (uso) and ecopetrol unions -- as well as several prominent figures whom they listed in the letter to the president. (end recording)    gonzalez added that he agrees with comptroller rodolfo gonzalez that the government should talk with the eln, a guerrilla group which in the past has been the most unwilling to join the peace process.
